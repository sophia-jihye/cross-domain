These things outperform the huge [UNK] ear muff set I use mainly to mow in. These things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower. 4) Conclusion: The only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way. When moving around, you NEED to have it clipped to something, otherwise it can create inner ear [UNK]. This can get quite annoying. I've also caught the cord on things, causing the clip to bend away from the module. It is removeable and I was able to bend it back.

This system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room. Considering the price, sound quality is actually better then expected for me. The tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity. They may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren\\'t and are a bit heavier then they look. The center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low. The surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though. If set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well. Some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin. They are fixed and can\\'t be replaced. Also, if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you. The 8\" [UNK] is okay considering the price of the system. It is currently better then any other sub included in a home [UNK] system under $200. It isn\\'t powered, is very light (only 9 lbs) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass. The volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls. The receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs. It should be enough in most cases. An extra digtal input or two wouldn\\'t hurt but again the system is under $200. Setup couldn\\'t be easier. You just hook up the included microphone, place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote. The system will automatically sets up the speaker distance, delay and volume levels. The receiver comes with the basic pro logic II music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources. It also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they don\\'t really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all.

Not a particularly great solution - expensive (around $20 for each) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses.

You can even change the titles, artists, and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player. Yes, I realize this can also be done in [UNK], but sometimes you want to edit later, or you missed something earlier. 5. Replaceable battery. If it dies, you can get another one, you don't have to send it in to the company. Dislikes: 1. The [UNK] mode is annoying. It doesn't go through the entire [UNK] on [UNK]. Once a song is over, it goes right back onto the potential [UNK], and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played, to the exclusion of the other items on the list.

That's okay though for people like me: I don't run. It also makes it cheaper than the IPod Nano, which is a flash player. 4. The cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer. I don't like this because I'm not always around my computer, I don't lug it with me everywhere I go.

       "       [\"The very first [UNK] player I bought was [UNK]'s very first 5 [UNK] [UNK] changer back in 1998. It was an excellent player, but as the technology improved, it could no longer keep up. I upgraded to a single [UNK] [UNK] which could handle DTS, and later to another single [UNK] player which could handle progressive video. But I always missed the convenience of a 5 [UNK] changer after having been spoiled by one at the start. At about one-third the price of that original [UNK] changer, this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player. It produces an excellent picture, has lots of tweakable settings, has more outputs, and is also very stylish looking. I do have a couple of nits, though. My original [UNK] changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever [UNK] I wanted. With this one, I have to press a [UNK] Skip button to cycle through all the [UNK]s until I reach the one I want. The front of the player does have direct access buttons, though. I wish I still had my old remote control as I'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality. Second, the upscaling through [UNK]MI produces a great image, but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p. In fact, upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture. It's also unfortunate that while connected through [UNK]MI, progressive scan cannot be turned off. This shouldn't be an issue most of the time, but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off. Progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote, but they cannot be turned off when connected through [UNK]MI. One last thing about the [UNK]MI connection. There can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using [UNK]MI connections and digital TVs. This is not a problem with the player, but with the way [UNK]MI is currently implemented. This player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem. However, the audio-sync adjustment doesn't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs. Since I need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound, the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here. And that's a shame. By the way, there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component, s-video, or composite outputs. There's also a minor thing I've found about all my [UNK] [UNK] players that I haven't liked. They are unable to correctly display Time Remaining on certain [UNK]s, or more commonly on the special features (documentaries, etc.) on certain [UNK]s. I also have a cheapo Philips player which has no problems displaying Time Remaining on those things (even on the menu). It's an improvement I'd really like to see implemented on future players. Now, despite the complaints I've listed above, don't get me wrong. This is still an excellent player and I really love it. I happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it. It really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances, and I feel it's the best [UNK] player I've ever owned. It's just not quite perfect.

This isn't an issue with Battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator, but I could see where if a game didn't have as good an interface (or maybe older games) this pad could suffer in this regard. 3. This isn't so much an issue for me, but I would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan, that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out.

       "       [\"We bought this external drive after learning that our friends lost all but a couple months worth of photos and/or videos from their first year with adorable triplet daughters. It resulted from the dreaded and inevitable hard-drive crash that everyone fears, but nobody thinks will happen to them. Attempts by two data recovery firms were unsuccessful and now they're left with whatever printed photos they and their family and friends could find. Expecting our first child in less than three weeks, we don't want to find ourselves in the same predicament, especially with years of other irreplaceable photos, financial data and other documents on our laptop. Now we're doing weekly, monthly and annual [UNK]s and storing some of those offsite to protect against something even worse than a simple crash of a hard drive. Even if we don't completely stick with this new regimen, it's better than what we used to do -- which, though thankfully uneventful, was absolutely nothing. If that's not enough to make you want to buy this, then the [UNK] name, quality, reliability and ease of use should be. The drive is small, stylish, easily installed and takes up little space in the vertical position. Although it's a little loud when the drive is working, it reads and writes CD-R media up to 48x, Ultra Speed Plus CD-RW up to 32x, DVD+/-R up to 16x, and High Speed DVD+RW up to 8x. After a lengthy initial full [UNK] using the included Nero BackItUp software (about 8 GB onto 10 old CD-R discs in 2.5-3.0 hours), smaller differential monthly [UNK]s and incremental weekly [UNK]s to 8x DVD+RW discs take between 10 and 20 minutes each when compressing, copying and verifying everything. [UNK] copies of our 4 GB wedding DVD onto 8x DVD-R discs took about 15-20 minutes. The Nero software seems very extensive, but I haven't used much of it so far. The interface is pretty intuitive and it's easy to find what you want to do, but some of the more detailed or technical options might be overwhelming for someone who's new to this kind of software or doesn't want to spend a lot of time reading the PDF manual. The only real complaint I have is with the BackItUp program's job scheduler, which only gives you daily, weekly and yearly frequency options (you need to set up monthly [UNK]s as weekly jobs and either disable or skip them for several weeks in between months), it takes forever to re-scan files when building a new job on an existing one (setting up subsequent daily, weekly or monthly jobs based on the initial full annual [UNK]), and the data you can change for an existing job is limited (can't rename it or alter the content without creating a whole new job). Overall, great external DVD/CD drive for watching video, listening to music and backing up data. Good software that's intuitive and functional with some room for improvement, but there's no real need for additional software you don't already have. Excellent value -- bought it at Amazon for under $160 with taxes and free shipping, and got a $30 mail-in rebate from [UNK].

The only drawbacks are the battery life if you don't use playlists, skip around a lot, or play high bitrate files (all of which are fixed rather well by Rockbox), and the subpack. What is a subpack? It's a fairly good idea done badly. It's a piece of [...] plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player.

It didn\\'t pick my preferred route to the interstate, and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four-lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate. (Although it did recover and finally suggest my route as I stubbornly drove \"my way.\") So, for a major trip, I\\'d recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route. Use this device if you have a lot of mind-numbing turn-by-turn. Now, what it does well: a) voice prompts are great. It doesn\\'t matter that it doesn\\'t say the street names. Turn right in 300 feet is good enough - especially with the map that you can glance at. b) It did great around my destination towns of Charlotte, NC; Gastonia, NC, and Rock Hill, SC. Did it take the best route as I drove from soccer fields, to hotels, to restaurants? I don\\'t know since I wasn\\'t familiar with the areas, but the routes seems to be just fine, they got me exactly where I needed to go, and I never had to look at a road map. And after all, this was the main reason I needed a newer [UNK]. It passed this with flying colors. c) My wife did some of the set-up while in the car. She\\'ll be using this one on her on very soon. d) We wanted to find a particular restaurant, but didn\\'t have the street address. The restaurant was in the Points of Interest database, and it took us right to it. Also, finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great. I also found a feature that was not listed in the 89-page manual. From the [UNK] map, if you touch the screen, it has a \"bypass route\" option. It will give you some distant options (1 mi, 5 mi, etc.) then it will find a bypass route for you. So, if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam, this will route you off the interstate, take you up the road and bring you back on. Obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving, but then it\\'s going to try to turn you around and/or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer. The bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out. In the future, I would like to do a side-by-side comparison w/ a more expensive (borrowed) [UNK]. Also, after more experience, I\\'d like to update this review. Bottom line: I am glad I bought this unit. I cannot imagine spending $100-$500 more on a more expensive model. Though the higher priced models may have better features, the value for the extra money just isn\\'t there for me',\n",

The reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the [UNK] properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the TV almost discouraged me from even buying this product. I decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my [UNK]. I am very happy that I decided to buy these cables. The cable connector fits perfectly into my [UNK], better than the connector on my original [UNK] cables even. The connectors fit nicely onto my TV, they are snug but not too tight. I believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my TV because of the 8-cut turbine connector, which fits better than a standard [UNK] plug. The video and audio from my [UNK] is unbelievable. My [UNK] pushes the video signal to my 32\" LCD HD TV at 480i with these cables. With my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry. Now the graphics are crisp and clear and I only wish I would have bought these sooner. The display from my [UNK] and games fits nicely onto my TV in widescreen now too, before the picture was not centered on my TV and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen. I would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their [UNK] over the stock [UNK] cables. There are other Monster Cable versions for the [UNK] available so choose the one that is right for you, but if you want something that is moderately priced, don\\'t need digital audio via fiber, and the next best thing to HDMI than this is the cable for you. I am going to get the Monster component cables for my [UNK] next so I will be able to hook it up when I don\\'t have HDMI available for it to use. One more thought, be sure to change the video output on your [UNK] from RGB to Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr in the system configuration before hooking up your [UNK] with these cables or it may not work.

This is one of the very few USB drives that lists the Read/Write [UNK] capabilities. The \"reality\" of flash drives is that the smaller the file size, the slower the transfer rate will be. I ran some tests with the Lightning to see what the transfer rate and the elapsed time is for groups of various file sizes: * 433MB 784 medium files, avg. 550KB 12X 4 min. 3 sec. * 483MB 81 large files, avg. 6MB 54X 59 seconds * 1GB 1 very large file 115X 58 seconds So, even though the Write [UNK] capability of the Lightning is 120X, the transfer rate drops to 12X with medium size files, which is fairly \"real-world\" usage. But, don\\'t let that dissuade you from considering the Lightning: The higher the \"[UNK] capability\" of the device, the better the transfer rate will be and the less time it will take to transfer those smaller files. To prove this point, I took one of my \"great deal\" CF cards (that had no [UNK] ratings) that tops out at 36X Read / 7X Write, and ran two of the same tests: * 433MB 784 medium files 3X 15 min. 10 sec. * 483MB 81 large files 7X 7 min. 48 sec. So, compared to the Lightning, the \"great deal!\" card took nearly 4 times longer to Write the medium files and 8 times longer to Write the large files. So, which is the better deal when you use the device over and over and over... Whether you are shopping for a card or a stick for digital cameras or a USB flash drive, if the performance numbers are not specified, BEWARE! What you might think is a great deal may get you a device with very poor performance that you will regret purchasing. I know, I have several in my drawer. So, my bottom-line advice is: Look for the highest-rated device you can find. Flash devices will last a looong time and our file sizes and amount of data will only grow!

Once on your noggin, the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head.

       "       ['I have been putting this television through its paces since I got it a few weeks ago, and it is by far the best TV I have ever owned, and very difficult to beat. The image quality is really good, with bright, vivid colors and wonderful detail, especially for 1080i/p content, but even lower-resolution 720p content, which is what\\'s more commonly-available on OTA HD broadcast, looks phenomenal. I also have an Apple TV hooked up to it, and even though most of my content is encoded at either 360p, 480p, or 720p, it still looks quite good. It does take some time to get the image tuned to perfection, and the default settings are way too bright with too much color saturation boost, and the DNIe processing system actually seems to make some motion effects worse. However, it\\'s very easy to change the settings and see immediately what effect they have. Like all LCDs it does have some slight black point problems; these aren\\'t noticeable for fullscreen 16:9 content, but for older 4:3 content it\\'s pretty obvious that the black isn\\'t pure black. However, this is again tunable. The only thing I really notice which is pretty annoying is that it doesn\\'t do a very good job of upscaling 480i content, such as the output from most video game systems, and for DVDs to look good you really need an upconverting player since even with a progressive-scan player there is a lot of visible [UNK] when the 480p content is scaled up. It\\'s really more a sad reflection on how the previous \"next-generation\" video looks downright primitive by today\\'s standards. The other noticeable issue is that unlike many televisions with digital tuners, it doesn\\'t have an on-screen program guide. My previous TV (also a Samsung) had an on-screen program guide, but it was rather cumbersome to use and took several minutes of scanning every channel to see what was on, and most local channels are pretty inconsistent about providing the EPG information anyway, so it\\'s not really that big of a deal. You can still see the detailed information for the program that\\'s currently showing, so it makes use of EPG, just not as much as it could. This television\\'s tuner is also quite phenomenal. My previous TV required a very carefully-positioned powered antenna which was very sensitive to every little nearby fluctuation, while with this one I only have a piece of wire jammed into the antenna port and I get perfect reception of every local digital station. Another nice improvement over Samsung\\'s older HDTVs is that it has a wide variety of zoom modes which allow you to counteract some of the stupider things that TV stations do (for example, pillboxing a letterboxed 16:9 show, which is very common for widescreen non-HD programming). Also, analog TV stations and source inputs get their audio signals upconverted to digital, so you only need to run a single optical audio connection to your stereo (while previous Samsungs required running both analog and digital cables and switching between the two inputs based on source material). As a PC monitor this is also quite nice. I have a Mac mini hooked up via SVGA cable, and even with an analog signal it looks perfectly sharp and crystal-clear, and of course you can hook it up via [UNK] (with a DVI to [UNK] adaptor) as well. The only gripe there is that the supported resolutions are a bit quaint - at least on analog SVGA the only 16:9 resolution it supports is 1920x1080, which can be difficult for some older systems to handle. However, on [UNK] it should support all the standard HD resolutions. This television may be more expensive than others in its size class, but it also far outshines every other TV I have seen, aside from the newer LN-T4065, which is nearly identical aside from providing a higher dynamic contrast ratio. If you want to only buy one TV which will last for a long time, it would be hard to go wrong with this one',\n",

       "       ['I\\'m a fanatic for duplexing since I move a LOT of paper around, sometimes amounts which I have to carry to court or mail and which weigh several pounds. The Brother is one of the better machines for the price that handles duplexing well, maybe even the best. This particular machine has [UNK] G built-in, but it costs over $100 more than the same machine without [UNK], and for well over $100, you can probably manage to do the same thing cheaper, maybe even better, and for my office, [UNK] is inappropriate. (It also should be stated that if you go outside Briother itself, then the [UNK] combo IS cost-effective. Brother essentially competes here only with itself.) That said, it makes for an elegant solution in the home if you have any sort of barrier to wiring and would like a single piece of equipment to handle everyone\\'s printing if several of you are running off of a [UNK] [UNK]. There are a bevy of bonuses if this machine is otherwise appropriate for you. It\\'s a complete standalone fax/copier if someone in the house doesn\\'t even have any computer at all. I\\'m a long-time Brother customer, and they\\'ve made operation more intuitive for both computer users and standalone. There were a few bugs in earlier machines by Brother (comparable but older machines I\\'ve owned, like the 8500 and the 9700) such as faulty out-of-toner warnings, and all of these seem to have been worked out. This machine is clearly out of beta. Earlier machines were difficult (though not impossible) to set up and use advanced functions without using your manual, and this machine is far better on that aspect as well. You can have faxes arrive two-sided, which doubles your paper tray effectively, and you can scan or fax a two-sided document just by feeding it in and possibly altering a setting. This last is made possible by the physical arrangement and just as much by the aforementioned ease-of-use - you wouldn\\'t use the feature much if you had to do major messing around with menus just send out a two-sided page. Unfortunately, the one bane of all printers which is slightly worse with the Brothers is the \"ink\" aspect. Unlike some competitors, you have to replace a toner AND a drum, and at differing intervals. I assume they do this to keep the costs low, but the costs still aren\\'t particularly low. The non-[UNK] version of the basic machine sells for a little over $400, and there is no problem spending that much for just a couple of drums and a few toners. I don\\'t understand why printers of all sorts cannot just have a \"gas tank\" you could fill with cheap ink and then just add paper, but in most instances, the consumables are the tail wagging the dog in terms of buying a printer. The Brother is a superbly-functioning modern machine at a great price, but don\\'t imagine the price ends when you buy it. This is true of all printers, however, and the news with most printers is worse than here',\n",

The capability to connect external battery is great, since that can help reduce the downtime when California experiencing \"rolling black\" in the summer. There are basically 2 differences between the Back-[UNK] RS([UNK]) and the Back-[UNK] XS ([UNK]) models besides their names. 1. The Back-[UNK] RS models have both 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem data-line protection and 10/100base-T ethernet protection, where as the Back-[UNK] XS models only has 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem protection. 2. The Back-[UNK] RS models have both Boost* and Trim** as features of Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR), where as the Back-[UNK] XS only has Boost. When the input voltage increases above the high transfer point of a Back-[UNK] XS model it will only go to battery. *AVR Boost: The [UNK] is compensating for a low utility voltage.

       "       ['First off... I like this unit. It\\'s EASY to use, and it does a fine job of taking your old LPs and making CDs out of them. All you need to do is place a blank [UNK] CD into the deck (it doesn\\'t work with regular data CDs), hit the phono/aux button, followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the LP... take it out of pause. It starts [UNK] instantly. Between each song, hit a button and it break the [UNK] into tracks. Pretty cool! It\\'s got great potential, but there are still a few shortcomings. For example, I was surprised to see that it doesn\\'t let you record off of the radio. Just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio [UNK] wasn\\'t digital. It\\'s a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations. You turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago. I wouldn\\'t mind the analog [UNK] too much if it at least had a handful of presets. This also makes the remote control somewhat useless too. Oddly, the remote does have an AM/FM button. They should just label it the \"Radio\" button, because when you think of it, switching from AM to FM or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re-tune the station too, using the dial. Another key point is that the unit doesn\\'t have any outputs at all. So you can\\'t pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers. I would rate this as 3.5 stars, but since we can\\'t use half stars, I\\'ll give it 4 for one big reason.... For all it\\'s shortcomings, it works, and there are very few alternatives. Speaking of alternatives, here are a few other options. 1. A standalone CD-[UNK]. I have one of these too. The advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old [UNK] deck. In my case, my stand alone unit has two drives, so not only can I record from any source in my system, but I can dub from one drive to the other. Also, my deck can make MP3 CDs from regular CDs (It\\'s easier than using a PC, however the song titles are just numbers). In my case, I opted not to use this for my LP projects, because I no longer have a turntable. I decided that as long as I needed a new turntable, I might as well pay a bit more for this unit. 2. Crosley makes a simuilar unit, but it costs a bit more and the reviews I read seemed to point out that although it looks better, the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot. 3. A portable digital [UNK] like the iKey Plus. I found one of these a few weeks ago and I love it. You plug your turntable or other external source into it... plug a USB storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality (.WAV vs several MP3 sampling rates)... Viola! It records directly to your flash drive, iPod or external hard drive. If you do go that route, make sure you get the \"Plus\" model. The older model is outdated and doesn\\'t work as well. 4. Use a PC. Even though it will give you the best possible sound and options, it\\'s out of the question for me because I do not want to move my PC near my stereo every time I want to make a [UNK], nor do I want to move my stereo next to my PC... or bog it down while I\\'m trying to use it for that matter. Keep in mind that if you record your CDs using one of the stand alone decks, you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the CDs you made into a PC afterwards, then filtering the files with your favorite [UNK] software, then re-burn the files to CD or MP3.',\n",

Of course I wanted one for myself, but cash is cash, so I\\'ve been putting it off. (Side note - I wanted to borrow it for a trip this past spring, and when they went to get it, it had been stolen from their car map-pocket. It seems these are high-theft items; keep\\'em on a short leash.) My wife hadn\\'t gotten me any \"big\" Christmas gift, so I told her I knew what I wanted, and started shopping. I debated between the eXplorist 500 and 600. Chose the 600, with its altimeter and thermometer. Probably could have lived without them, but hey, it\\'s Christmas! It came yesterday, so I charged it a bit, and then it had no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover. I had to go out to the street for the [UNK] to find satellites. Took it out for a spin today. Spot-on navigation as I ran errands. It tracked back almost to the exact spot I had marked for home, though it had me driving down the wrong side of the street on that portion of my route that was a duplicate - so it\\'s off by a few feet. (Maybe it still thinks it\\'s in Britain?) Now - why only 4 stars? 1) the USB connector can attach to the unit either way. There\\'s no instructions anywhere to say which way it should go. I called the 800 # and spoke with someone (in New Delhi) who had heard this a lot. She told me what to do, and the PC immediately recognized the [UNK] file system - as a removable disk drive, as advertised. I really find their Website information near-zero. Something as elementary as this should be covered on a Website after the 3rd call, eh? 2) I bought the Mapsend 3D Topo software. I am interested in elevations. And it has detailed street maps. BUT - they\\'re not routable! If you want routable streets (where the unit will route you along streets and not just a crow\\'s flight direct path) for following in a car, then either you have to get both map products, or choose. It\\'s rather frustrating. And the sales information provided on Amazon and the [UNK] sites does not make this critical lack very clear. It tells you what you can do, but not what you can\\'t and there\\'s no product comparison to see what the differences are. On the Mapsend Topo box, it says very clearly, \"NAVTEQ roads and streets data - like that found in the most expensive car navigation systems (non-routable)\". Er, excuse me, then it\\'s not quite like that found in expensive car systems, is it? I concur with other reviewers who find the software selection verbiage (on Amazon and [UNK]) more obfuscating than informative.

Now, if you are undecided about which camp to follow ([UNK]-ray or HD DVD), I'm here to tell you that [UNK]-ray will win. You see, I have both [UNK]-ray and HD DVD. I have about 20 HD DVD movies and about 20 [UNK]-ray movies. In terms of picture and sound quality, they are the same, but it is completely dependant on the software. But here is where the similarities end. 1) [UNK]-ray is more durable. The BD movie [UNK]s have scratch-resistant coating. They don't scratch unless you forcefully scratch them. On the other hand, the [UNK] movies scratch like heck. I put all of my movies in a CD case. I recently noticed that ALL the [UNK] movies are scratched, but NONE of the [UNK]-ray movies are scratched. These are stored in the SAME CD case by me. I am extremely careful. None of my movies even have a fingerprint on them. So when I see scratches on 100% of my [UNK] movies, that really upsets me!!!!! 2) [UNK]-ray costs less to BUY. What? Superman Returns BD is $24, Superman [UNK] is $28. The Departed BD is $24, The Departed [UNK] is $28. Now the [UNK] DUAL format has both a standard DVD and [UNK] movie, but who in their right mind would want to buy an [UNK] to watch a 480p picture? Right now you can get a $500 PS3 or $400 Toshiba [UNK] player. Later this year, Sony will come out with a $300 [UNK]-Ray [UNK] player. [UNK] will most likely drop their prices. So the hardware will cost the same in both formats. 3) [UNK]-ray has more capacity. For less money, you can get a 50GB [UNK]-ray movie versus a 30GB [UNK] movie. And what if in 5 years they develope SUPER High-Definition 1920p picture and SUPER Hi-Def 8.1 DTS-HD Sound? What if this requires 75GB or 100GB? [UNK] can go up to 51GB. Peace.\",\n",

I knew that this device only reads WMV but it \"supports\" DIVX, XVID, MPEG, etc. This \"support\" deppends on what the [UNK] can play. So this means that you sincronyze (via [UNK]) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into [UNK] movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your PMC secreen size. I had this in mind when I bought it and was fine with me untill I tried it the first time: The [UNK] wouldnt convert my XVID movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that I had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the [UNK]. So after uninstalling and installing I was good to go so I converted a 1:45hr long movie in only 25 minutes. But this short moment of joy was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the [UNK] fits the widescreen movies into the PMC and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable!!!! You cant change this because the [UNK] does this automatically. My answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into WMV files. The problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert...I have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the [UNK]. In the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the [UNK] and it does it very fast and with good quality. You can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so I think this option is useless on the PMC. So the veredict is: The PMC-120 is a good multimedia player with minor glitches. It is a little bulky but personally I think the size is not that big. I think the good side of the size issue comes along with its big 3.6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video. If you want to play directly your DIVX or XVID movies on your player buy another porduct like the iRiver PMP series or the Archos players wich are way, way, WAY more expensive. So I think that for the price and for what it does the PMC-120 gets two thumbs up.',\n",
