Although, I would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that's like 6\" thick (even though it still may hold). It's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place, although those tend to fall off when you move them. But that's no big deal. Just put them back on.

      "After using my iM716s for about 4 months now I have a few things to say about them. 1) Price: Lists for $199 on Altec's site. $70 is a steal. 2) Quality: Top notch in the earphones, the clip on the volume module is weak. 3) Performance: Bar none best I've had. These things outperform the huge [UNK] ear muff set I use mainly to mow in. These things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower. 4) Conclusion: The only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way. When moving around, you NEED to have it clipped to something, otherwise it can create inner ear [UNK]. This can get quite annoying. I've also caught the cord on things, causing the clip to bend away from the module. It is removeable and I was able to bend it back. If there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module, even for the same price, I'd go that route. With that said, I am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60GB video ipod\n",

      "I, like many other people that have written reviews here, researched the [UNK] of an [UNK] player in great detail.

If you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on [UNK], this is the unit that you want. iPod will not let you download your own songs, I did not know that until after I [UNK]d this player (thankfully). This unit was the highest rated unit by far that I was able to scour the internet for. If this is your first [UNK] of an [UNK] player (like mine) buy this one, no questions asked. Do not worry about trying to buy $80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal. Crisp, clear, awsome base and I have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40. I cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing. I received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when I got home from work and by 6:35 I have transfered the 114 artists folders (about 4,000+ songs) that I had ripped on my computer last week (about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player). I would recomend buying the cradle, it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo, which I plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool. Absolutley buy this unit. I have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and I have a high performance expectation and it has met it\n",

      "If you want a budget home [UNK] system for under $200 there is probably not many systems better then the [UNK] HT-DDW700. This system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room. Considering the price, sound quality is actually better then expected for me. The tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity. They may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't and are a bit heavier then they look. The center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low. The surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though. If set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well. Some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin. They are fixed and can't be replaced. Also, if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you. The 8\" [UNK] is okay considering the price of the system. It is currently better then any other sub included in a home [UNK] system under $200. It isn't powered, is very light (only 9 lbs) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass. The volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls. The receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs. It should be enough in most cases. An extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again the system is under $200. Setup couldn't be easier. You just hook up the included microphone, place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote. The system will automatically sets up the speaker distance, delay and volume levels. The receiver comes with the basic pro logic II music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources. It also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they don't really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all. Basically, if you want a home [UNK] system for a small room and for under $200 then there isn't much better then the [UNK] HT-DDW70\n",

      "I've owned many [UNK] electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen, useful shortwave and portable radios, stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders. I still have a [UNK] mini component [UNK] model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new [UNK] [UNK] component [UNK] (made in China). PLUSES: decent sound good functionality easy set-up and intuitive operation simple remote -- but only covers basic functions CONS: very short speaker leads unattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox only holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic units At first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies. But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400. Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China. So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding [UNK] unit for the bedroom. The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty. I haven't blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed. I originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).

      "After looking around at the local stores (Fry's and CompUSA) I had just about given up on finding a single [UNK] that would offer reasonable [UNK] for my iPod in multiple environments - on my belt and also in exercise, and had resigned myself to having a \"skin\" type [UNK] for just everyday use and then shifting the iPod to an arm band for exercise. Not a particularly great solution - expensive (around $20 for each) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses. Then I ran into the DLO Action Jacket at Best Buy, which seemed to cover all my intended uses. Unlike the prior reviewer, I found my 40g iPod fits VERY snugly - absolutely zero slop, and I really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one [UNK]. Also, at $29.95, it's cheaper than the two-[UNK] approach. The only criticism I have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the [UNK] and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the [UNK]. The process is a little tedious, but the end result is great. The unit feels very secure on my arm and it's easy to forget that it's there. This jacket is a winner\n",

I agree with the previous reviews, that it is something that [UNK] needs to look into, perhaps it is simply a matter of a \"heat sink-er\" not being in specs, as yet, I have encountered no problems (having had the [UNK] unit for 1.5 years) No matter. As to the commercial free: Sirius (which I have had a subscription to for the past 4 years) has commercial free [UNK], though the news stations and a few others do have commercials. Those stations are clearly defined as being in the commercial block. The music stations are 100% free of commercial.

It has a cable which is split into two USB [UNK]s - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second [UNK] does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a [UNK] called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow [UNK] off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately.

I was really afraid because there are so many [UNK]s on the market and all of them claim to be good, but as I found out with my [UNK] experience, that is not always true. My brother has an older model [UNK] [UNK] and although his is slow, it has made a handful of [UNK]s in the 5 years that he has owned it, so I took a chance and purchased the [UNK] DRU-810A. That was the best decision I could have made. I will never buy another brand [UNK] other that [UNK] brand. I have had this [UNK] about 7 or 8 months. I am a very heavy [UNK] and I have not made one [UNK]. One thing I loved about my brother's [UNK] [UNK] is that I could use any brand of media. The same thing is true of the DRU-810A. I don't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is. This [UNK] loves everything. I had looked at the Plextor brand, but I did'nt want to pay $100.00 and I looked at NEC brand, LiteOn, BenQ. etc., but I am so happy that I passed on them all and got the [UNK]. It burns super fast. Some people say that it is loud, but it's not loud to me. I got my [UNK] from Tiger Direct for $50.00. My sister's computer came with a crappy [UNK] brand [UNK] too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but [UNK]s too, so for Christmas I am buying her a [UNK] DUR-810A so she can finally burn some movies.

Don't know why I waited soo long to get one (dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one). Although made of plastic, it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding. The clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold.

The driver software is very tolerant. You can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device. So installation is a 5 minute process. Next comes the capture and initial encoding. Well, the software is a bit lame as far as features and GUI. Typical. But it absolutely saves in [UNK]2 / [UNK] format just as you'd need it to for making [UNK]s of all your Dish Network or PS2 or [UNK] content. The frame rate is full on 30 fps. It takes an SVIDEO or standard RCA video signal. Both are just fine in quality. The resolutions are not that great... but its passable for [UNK] when you crank it up. Don't think you can encode some Blu-Ray quality [UNK] with this though. As far as the overall durability of the product, I've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight. It gets hot, but its never so much as flickered or needed reset.

      "This is a great piece of hardware, the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me. But in my apartment I would like to have more control over the [UNK] speaker, it's volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself. The bass sound from [UNK]is overbearing at default. The other thing is that I would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an [UNK]. That's not going to happen with this system, you can't change that easily. And yes the 5 disk changer is slow. The maximum volume setting doesn't seem that loud to me, but then I have the decibal settings at default. All the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here, it has all the flavors. Hooking it up to an [UNK] directly didnt work the way I'd like it too, but I only tried [UNK] and not the digital. I have a sony 32\" Wega and I had the [UNK] patch to it and then routed to the DAV-FX100 reciever. That works like a charm, even with 5.1 sound from [UNK]. One huge complaint I have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best. I see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers, even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my TV.

      "You may as well pitch the instructions because they're worthless (and the only reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating for the ADS Tech Video Xpress). I was about ready to pitch the product as well, after losing two evenings trying to figure out how to get it to work. Ultimately, I gave up on relying solely on the program it came with, and I instead opted to try it on my Windows Movie Maker. Yahoo! Perseverance paid off! Once I switched to Movie Maker, this tool worked great! To date, I've converted about a dozen videos of content to computer files that I was able to burn to [UNK]s. I just leave my Xpress hooked up to the back of my television so I don't have to try to remember later how to hook it up again. Doing that, I can connect my laptop to the Xpress and start the video converting process within 3-4 minutes. My Movie Maker program takes over the entire process. The ADS Tech Video Xpress has been especially useful for me because I teach a college telecourse and often show edited video clips to my students. Before purchasing Xpress, I had crudely edited videos that I was reluctant to use; my videos had lots of amateur stop/start points. Using Movie Maker with Xpress, I was able to download these videos to my laptop, then easily edit them so transitions between stop and start points became smooth and seamless. Pretty cool. I'm glad I took a chance on this product! Below are hook-up and program instructions I've written to myself for easy reference later. Hopefully they'll be of more help to you than the instructions that come with this product: First, hook up the Video Xpress equipment as follows: 1. S-cable (buy one, since it doesn't come with the VideoXpress) goes from the back of your television to the VideoXpress. 2. Use red/white/yellow cords running into the back of the [UNK]/[UNK] that is hooked up to your televion as follows: - all three plug into the \"video out\" column - all three plug into the VideoXpress tool at the other end. 3. The USB plug for the VideoXpress tool plugs into the back of the computer. Next, open the Instant Video Xpress program and verify the settings are as follows: - \"NTSC M\" for the video standard setting - \"640 x 480\" and \"60 FPS (VGA)\" for video format - \"[UNK], [UNK], TV\" for video source - \"Video composite\" for video input Under the program advanced settings: - Low motion (TV, [UNK], [UNK]) - CPU support: \"SSE3\" - Stereo system: \"MTS\" - Video decoder: \"video standard: NTSC_M\" Under properties within the program advanced settings: - Stream format: Video format: \"NTSC_M\" - Frame rate: \"59.940\" - Color space/compression: \"YUY2\" - Outputs size: \"640x480\" Finally, CLOSE the Instant Video Xpress program. (Windows Movie Maker can't access the video until this program is closed. And yes, it's silly to have to open it, make those setting changes, then close it, but Video Xpress won't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps.) In case you need this information for Windows Movie Maker, the steps (in order) are as follows: Under \"File,\" click on \"capture video.\" Use the following settings: - audio device set at: \"USB2.0 Analog Audio Device\" - Video input source set at: \"Composite\" Under Configure Video Capture Device: - Video format: Video standard: \"NTSC_M\" Frame rate: \"29.970\" Color space/compression: \"YUY2\" Output size: \"640x480\" Under Camera settings: - Deinterlace method: \"Low motion (TV, [UNK], [UNK])\" - CPU support: \"SSE3\" - Stereosystem: \"MTS\" Under Video decoder: Video standard: \"MTSC_M\" Signal detected: \"1\" Lines detected: \"525\" Then... Give the file a name and indicate where to save it Set it for \"best quality\" for playback. Then \"Start Capture.\" If the Video Xpress is hooked up and running correctly, you should see on your computer monitor the video image of whatever is showing on television, but you will NOT hear the sound. When you finish capturing and play it back, THEN you'll hear the sound. I know, I know -- clear as mud. But hey, it's better than the Xpress instructions! :-\n",

      "(Note to Brian: The [UNK] *can* be configured as a [UNK]. I have two of them in just such a configuration. Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.) Major modes of operation are: 1. [UNK] Access Point (its default set-up) 2. [UNK] Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the [UNK] and you now have a [UNK] ethernet device) 3. [UNK] Repeater (extend range of [UNK] coverage) 4. [UNK] [UNK] (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a \"virtual\" cable; you need two to get the job done) A pair of [UNK] [UNK]s is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the [UNK] because of Brian's comment that this wouldn't work. Because of my newness to the [UNK] world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work. I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons. 1. I understand that higher-end, more expensive, equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment! 2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is \"admin\". Well, it's not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes. 3. Something that 99% of the world won't care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other [UNK] products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it's attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this\n",

I have only used alkaline batteries so far, and have had excellent battery life. The menu takes an hour or 2 of playing with to learn, but once you get familiar with the buttons and menu, it's pretty easy.

Also, the included cases are pretty cheesy and I didn't even bother with them.

I was worried how the [UNK] would be handled, and sure enough, I was worried rightfully. The [UNK] tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out. The top of the receiver/[UNK] player had been slightly caved in. Even with all the packing [UNK] supplied, it could not protect the product from the [UNK] company. It will be such a hassle to try and exchange this, that I am not sure if I will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again. Other than that, I have purchased smaller items, and less fragile from [UNK] with no issues. I realize that the [UNK] damage canot be held on [UNK], as it is out of their control. I just don't think I will roll the dice on something like this in the future. Too bad, it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen\n",

It may look a little cheesy but it works. I didn't even need the [UNK] that comes with it in order to use the product.

      "I had an old [UNK] m100 for the longest time and used it as an electronic replacement for a paper [UNK]. But it ate batteries and wasn't rechargeable, so when I got a newer computer without a serial port (and discovered it would cost a fairly decent sum for a serial-USB connector), I decided to upgrade. Thought it'd be cool to have something with [UNK] playing capabilities as well, (I don't own an iPod or other small [UNK] player) but I didn't need many features beyond an [UNK] (didn't need for e-mail, etc) and didn't want to spend much over $75. Pros: I like the [UNK] interface, very intuitive. Calendar & contacts work well Plays [UNK]'s Syncs well with Outlook/computer Plugs in to recharge; all cords came with it. Easy to download new software (I recommend Blocks, it's similar to Tetris) Cons or caveats: Display: when viewing calendar in \"full month\" mode, I have trouble seeing any entries unless I view the screen at an angle. Not a deal-breaker, but a little odd. They probably improved this with newer (pricier) models, but you get what you pay for. I can read all other screens just fine. Haven't used it to display photos; I don't think I'd use this to do that--resolution isn't worth the effort. Expansion card: WARNING: WILL NOT READ ANY CARD OVER 1GB size! (I had purchased a 2GB card with the intent of putting [UNK]'s on it and listening to them on the Zire. Wouldn't read it. Didn't realize this till I read the fine print. Fortunately, I have a camera which takes SD cards so I can use in the camera). Listening to [UNK]'s: This really isn't gonna replace an iPod for features. They do say that listening to [UNK]'s uses more battery than other functions. I would agree but then I've not used this for long periods of time as an [UNK] player, so I can't really say. Functionally, [UNK]'s play just fine with RealOne player. Sound quality is pretty good BUT I have noticed a \"hiss\" background noise when using earbud-style headphones; it's a lot less noticeable with \"outside-the-ear\" style headphones. Recommendation: outside-the-ear style headphones with an in-line (cord) volume control. If you're in a quiet environment, the lowest volume level on the RealOne player isn't all that soft. With non-volume-adjustment headphones, the lowest volume level (there's a slider bar on screen) was the loudest I wanted to hear. Headphones with a volume adjustment fixes that problem. Overall, it's been worth the $$ for me as a replacement for my former m100, and it works ok as an [UNK] player, as long as you can recharge it on a regular basis\n",

      "There are some things I like about this, others I don't. Some people have written similar reviews, but I want to add my 2 cents. Hope this helps potential buyers. Likes: 1. Small, easy to use 2. Good sound quality 3. Good storage capacity for those of us who don't have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers. 4. Some people have complained that the Creative Media software is hard to understand. I disagree, I found it straightforward. You can even change the titles, artists, and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player. Yes, I realize this can also be done in [UNK], but sometimes you want to edit later, or you missed something earlier. 5. Replaceable battery. If it dies, you can get another one, you don't have to send it in to the company. Dislikes: 1. The [UNK] mode is annoying. It doesn't go through the entire [UNK] on [UNK]. Once a song is over, it goes right back onto the potential [UNK], and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played, to the exclusion of the other items on the list. I want to hear all my songs at least once before I hear repeats. 2. The Creative Media Center software doesn't install on Windows Vista. 3. This is a hard drive player, so no running with it. That's okay though for people like me: I don't run. It also makes it cheaper than the IPod Nano, which is a flash player. 4. The cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer. I don't like this because I'm not always around my computer, I don't lug it with me everywhere I go. However, there are ports you can buy (here on Amazon, even) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports, so that's handy. 5. Not as many accessories as the IPod, but not that important. 6. You can't view your photos while you are listening to music. Sometimes this sucks, but if you have a camera phone, or are in an actual conversation with someone, you probably won't be listening to your music anyway.\n",

      "The very first [UNK] player I bought was [UNK]'s very first 5 [UNK] [UNK] changer back in 1998. It was an excellent player, but as the technology improved, it could no longer keep up. I upgraded to a single [UNK] [UNK] which could handle DTS, and later to another single [UNK] player which could handle progressive video. But I always missed the convenience of a 5 [UNK] changer after having been spoiled by one at the start. At about one-third the price of that original [UNK] changer, this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player. It produces an excellent picture, has lots of tweakable settings, has more outputs, and is also very stylish looking. I do have a couple of nits, though. My original [UNK] changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever [UNK] I wanted. With this one, I have to press a [UNK] Skip button to cycle through all the [UNK]s until I reach the one I want. The front of the player does have direct access buttons, though. I wish I still had my old remote control as I'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality. Second, the upscaling through [UNK]MI produces a great image, but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p. In fact, upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture. It's also unfortunate that while connected through [UNK]MI, progressive scan cannot be turned off. This shouldn't be an issue most of the time, but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off. Progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote, but they cannot be turned off when connected through [UNK]MI. One last thing about the [UNK]MI connection. There can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using [UNK]MI connections and digital TVs. This is not a problem with the player, but with the way [UNK]MI is currently implemented. This player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem. However, the audio-sync adjustment doesn't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs. Since I need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound, the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here. And that's a shame. By the way, there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component, s-video, or composite outputs. There's also a minor thing I've found about all my [UNK] [UNK] players that I haven't liked. They are unable to correctly display Time Remaining on certain [UNK]s, or more commonly on the special features (documentaries, etc.) on certain [UNK]s. I also have a cheapo Philips player which has no problems displaying Time Remaining on those things (even on the menu). It's an improvement I'd really like to see implemented on future players. Now, despite the complaints I've listed above, don't get me wrong. This is still an excellent player and I really love it. I happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it. It really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances, and I feel it's the best [UNK] player I've ever owned. It's just not quite perfect. In all likelihood, it's also the last [UNK] player I'll ever own as I'll probably be buying a BluRay or other [UNK] player in a couple of years when that format war is over. But this is a great player to hold me over until then\n",

      "This is my second [UNK] - I used an NEC for the last four years, but that died on me recently. And, boy, am I glad it died - I am amazed by the quality of the [UNK] - the pictures and colors almost jump off the screen at you. Also, the oft mentioned LDC [UNK] 'screen door' effect is virtually non-existant - you have to stand almost next to the screen to notice it. I believe Panny used some smoothening technology to achieve it. The contrast is also truely outstanding for an LCD [UNK] - at par with DLP systesm, but without the headaches of the rainbow effect. Couple of pointers which might be helpful to other users. When I first started using the [UNK] with my DVD player I was getting some wavy curls (not too visible, but still there) that seemed to flow across the screeen. However, after about 4-5 hours of use, they have disappeared - so if any of you see those wavy curls, just give it a few hours and hopefully yours will disappear as well. Secondly, unlike my old NEC I was getting a flickering shimmer when using my HD box from my cable company. The shimmer was just at the edge of teh picture. There is an easy fix for this. Go to options, overscan, and you can actually crop the edge of the image and not see it any more...voila - no flickers and an incredible picture. Be aware that this is big, bulky [UNK] compared to some others out there. Definately not a portable one - you don't want to be lugging it home from work after presentations to see home pictures.

I bought this [UNK] specifically for Star Wars Battlefront 2 on PC, and it works like a dream. I also like the X-Box [UNK] layout (offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic) than the PS2 style [UNK] that is the Logitech Rumble pad. It also has better grips than a PS2 [UNK]. The only things I think are bad about it are the following: 1. It is not modeled on the large XBox [UNK], but rather the regular one, which is ok for most people, but I have big hands and I get a bit cramped up if I play for way too long. 2. I was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad. I have a Saitek Cyborg EVO [UNK] that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game. This isn't an issue with Battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator, but I could see where if a game didn't have as good an interface (or maybe older games) this pad could suffer in this regard. 3. This isn't so much an issue for me, but I would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan, that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out. I don't care too much, because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything. I will still use it even if it does die. Overall, a great [UNK], I actually would give it a 4.5 rating, but that isn't an option here\n",

      "Maybe I'm bias because I really like [UNK], maybe, because I have kinda' good ears or, it's the fat check sitting on my table from [UNK]; but what ever it is I realllllllly like this sub-woofer. I looked around a long time for the right sub, and, I like to think I got a good one here. You want power? Ok, it's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like Velodyne, but in my room (30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling) it ROCKS. I love music, all kinds; loud or quiet no matter I like both, but I do like depth more than volume. However, I believe if you are going to listen to something real loud, being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it. And let me say you can FEEL music if you want to. one of the things I love most about this sub is it's range; it can (maybe) reach 20 hertz. 20 hertz! that is astounding. 20Hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear, in fact it's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard. Maybe I have good ears and maybe I don't, but to hear rich airy low-end, and, [UNK] notes. yes! [UNK] NOTES! [UNK] is not one big boomy lump of noise, it's huge, open, grazing pasture of distinct sounds! In short, music sounds great, even hip-hop (which I don't like) sounds, well, better. Also, their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement; at very quiet levels too, you can hear good clean [UNK] notes. But, if you do a lot of quite listening, we're talking back ground music levels: disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off, because if you happen to be listening to something quiet, even if you still can here low notes from this, it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on, well... on. It improves movies as well, take something with a lot of dynamics like, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" or, \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" there are a lot of sudden loud, and very low sounds in those movie's and the [UNK] handles it all with aplomb. With most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy, and if you are wondering about the \"[UNK]\" button: if the button is in the \"music\" position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the \"movie\" position (I think \"music\" is a flatter frequency response). As this review seems to be getting a bit long I'll some it up: yes, there are far better [UNK]s out there (like from B&W), but I don't have the money for those, and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt Velodyne I would take it in a heartbeat- but, I wouldn't want to give this one up too. It's a absolute pleasure to listen to. Update: I have run some test tones on this [UNK], and well, it can not reach 20Hz. 38Hz seems to be the limit for usable [UNK], although it is still audible to around 32Hz, 20Hz is a stretch. If 38Hz sounds to high: their are not many movie's or CD's that have any sounds below 35Hz. And very, very few have sound below 25Hz. Although it does not go as low as I would have hoped, it is still a good sub for the money, and still worth a five star review\n",

(e.g. the official drivers released in February 2007 are missing several features in Windows [UNK]. Like good TV-Out support, Hibernation support, proper Ntune support. The March 2007 released [UNK] beta drivers seems to cause a lot of people to have video driver crashes during games. Check [UNK]'s message board for more info.) Once [UNK] straightens out their [UNK] drivers issues, this [UNK] will be golden. As it is, the latest Beta drivers did improve [UNK]... but it introduced some stability issues. Also, EVGA's 90-day Step-Up program will hopefully allow me to jump into the 8900 series that is rumored to be released late-April 2007. LASTLY... it puts off an odd digital whine in 3D games and when resizing windows. I returned one (with green circuitboard) and got a new one form Amazon (black circuitboard) and it did the same thing. Amazon reimbursed me the return shipping! The digital whine isn't too bad, but its fairly annoying if you have your game sound really low. I play with headphones, so I don't really care\n",

      "In general, [UNK]'s USB [UNK] does its job just as well as other USB [UNK]s; there isn't much of a difference except for the following: 1) portability good: it has a convenient way of attaching to your keychain bad: this rubber holder only lasts for so long (in my case 6-8 months) 2) it is extremely durable. This [UNK] survived a full 30 minute (clothes) washer cycle. When I took it out of the washer, I thought all the data and the [UNK] was gone for good. To my surprise (after letting it dry for a day) it worked just fine. This is amazing! I have also accidentally stepped on it while wearing shoes (not using all of my weight though) a few times on carpet and concrete; and still works fine. Finally, I have dropped this [UNK] on a variety of surfaces and it's still fine. 3) looks: good: it is very easy to see since it is bright red bad: it is fatter than other USB [UNK]s and it is bright red. The [UNK] is pretty ugly. It maybe good to note however, that the [UNK]'s structure is probably a good reason as to why it has survived my abuse. The bright red color's advantage has already been mentioned above\n",

      "I've used the SD-YD250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear. Overall, the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor-saving [UNK]. I've used it equally for baking [UNK] and making [UNK] [UNK]. It can also save a lot of money, provided you purchase the [UNK] in bulk (for example 2lb). The single use [UNK] packages which are typically the only buying option at American supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram. Particularly great savings are possible when using it to make [UNK] [UNK]. This takes the tedious work out of making your own [UNK], and when the [UNK] is refrigerated for later use, it tastes even better in my opinion. Like most engineered products of our age, this one is full of cute features that add little value, or cause annoyance. The [UNK] dispenser makes a marginal difference at best. If you use it, you (for the most part) create extra work for yourself because you'll have to clean it later. The dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use. They make a marginal difference in baking results. I only use the quick bake mode, which takes 2 hours to complete. Let's say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings (easy to do given the many parameters you can set). You just push the reset or cancel button and start over, right? Nope, no such button exists. Then unplug the unit and plug it back in, right? Nope, the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages, so the unit remembers where it left off. Yes, but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes, and after 10 minutes it will forget, right? Nope, I tried this, too. The unit does indeed forget eventually, but it's more than 11 minutes. If you plug it back too early, the timer resets and you have to wait again. To summarize, the hardware is excellent, and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber\n",

He loves to strum it, but he definitely needs to be supervised to teach him to respect that it is a special musical [UNK], not a [UNK]. So far he has sat on it and used it as a drum and it's held up fine, but I don't think it would hold up with such continued abuse. It is recommended for [UNK]ren much older than he is, so I can't expect anything different. I do wish they made a smaller version of it so it would be more comfortable for him. For a better price than I see at Amazon, you can get a small [UNK] [UNK] at a music store, which might be better quality, I'm not sure. Regardless, I am very happy with this [UNK] and I would recommend it for any [UNK] who shows a real interest in music.

I must say after installing my [UNK] that this [UNK] was a perfect choice. Some might say that the cost reflects a [UNK]s ability to provide good sound. Wrong. This is just as good as those 70 dollar [UNK]. I do buy monster [UNK] for most of my home theatre needs, but I do not buy into some of the hype surrounding Monster [UNK] and their more expensive [UNK]s. Why only 4 and not 5 stars.

There is decent [UNK], but the highs are a bit soft. A quick tweak to my [UNK], and they're great. After reading several of the reviews on Amazon, I was a bit worried about the sound, but now that I have them I'm very happy.

They didn't sound real good and didn't come supplied with the [UNK] bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your [UNK]s. What's the deal with that? Next came the old Sony MDR 027 head phones from the closet. The Sony's have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the [UNK]s now. They worked o.k., I guess, but in comparison these JBuds sound MUCH better than either of the previous ones. I'm now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine. I'm h[UNK]ing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models. Crisper highs, great mid range, and responsive lows. Set up was fast too, just find the correct size [UNK] bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running. The JBuds actually stay in your [UNK]. Wow what a concept. They are also very comfortable due to the fact I forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing. The cord is just the right length for setting the [UNK] on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket. If you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie. Better too much than not enough. So back to the closet with the Sony. I guess what it all boils down to is you could do a whole lot worse than these especially for a mere twenty bucks. I couldn't have made a better choice for the money and quality. You should do the same. Another quick note. The shipping went great. Not too long at all and with standard USPS. Thanks Amazon\n",

      "I made the mistake to buy the [UNK] [UNK] pointer before this one. The [UNK] is a good one, very well made, but it is slightly more expensive and lacks the [UNK] control. I to not know any cheaper model with [UNK] function. I can maybe prefer a bit the ergonomy of the [UNK], together with the very practical possibility to store the USB receiver inside the unit, but this is probably just my taste and the [UNK] is quite comfortable either and lighter. My [UNK] has the embarrassing feature that the [UNK] pointer is interpreted as RETURN on some applications (Exporer on Windows and Opera on Mac OS, for instance). I do not know it that is a bug or if there is some reason for that. However the [UNK] does not have this behaviour and that is another reason for which I prefer it. The wheel system of the [UNK] presenter is very practical. Compared with my [UNK] I found no difference in the quality of the [UNK]: both do their job perfectly. The [UNK] control is simple and practlical and it will take a very short time to be confident with it. My unit worked perfectly wothout extra software on both Mac an PC. Overall I am extremely satisfied. On the minus side, the labels on the button on the side are printed with very poor colours. the \"fn\" label diapperared immediately after a few days of usage. A bit disappointing, but, after all, nothing really important. The unit also lacks programmable buttons, but I do not know any presenter with this feature. Bottomline. This presenter works well, it is not expensive, and the [UNK] control is a true must\n",

In the car: It is accurate and maps [UNK]s quickly 90% of the time. The other 10% of the time it either looses signal, has outdated maps (my update is ordered and on it's way as I type), or just slow processing for some reason. Of this 10% of the time I'd say only 2% of the time has this been an actual problem for me. The rest of the time I was able to simply guess what I needed to do next or it didn't matter at all. I have not found a perfect way of fixing the slow [UNK] calcuations, but the vast majority of the time this hasn't been an issue. On foot: One of the features that sold me on this was the fact that it had a long lasting battery and it was waterproof. Both qualities needed to be used for hiking. The only catch is you have to turn off the lock to roads, otherwise you will get some really confusing directions! Also it is difficult to program in destinations by coordinates as opposed to addresses, but it can be done (put in and address then change everything including the coordinates in the confirmation screen before hitting [UNK]!). On Boat: Haven't tested this as I don't have a boat, and haven't purchased the water based maps. Overall I'm very happy with this and looking forward to the map update.

I'd like to also try the [UNK] vertical over the head cheapos as well as the Sony folding ones. They did come in very handy when my scroll wheel on my Rio Carbon was broken (only volume control on the thing). For reference, my everyday buds are Sony ED21LPs, which I highly reccomend for all purpose use as they wont fall out, and can be stored in a very small area. Heck, I even use the stupid pouch that comes with them. But, yeah, knowing the weaknesses of the p9, if you think you'd like it, then you'll love it\n",

I installed as a network device and set up the software on my XP Pro as well as Mac OS 10.4.9 machines ... easy installation, and the interface on each OS is essentially the same. Super fast [UNK]s from either machine, crisp and beautiful, with tonal background fills [UNK]ing which never showed up on my previous [UNK] laser. Duplex scan/fax as well as duplex [UNK] was the key to my purchase, and I've been really happy. What I did not anticipate was just how fast the [UNK] is, or how rich the delivered software is compared with prior [UNK] experience. Noises don't seem unusual to me - no crackling here, just noisy paper handling by ADF and [UNK] engine. No big deal IMHO. Only a few minor negatives I've seen so far: (1) it looks like the firmware can only be updated from a Windows computer, so Mac folks are stuck there (mine was delivered with current version of firmware, so maybe this doesn't matter), (2) you cannot feed heavy stock through it, even the manual feed tray - so need to keep a straight feed device around if you need thicker than 24# stock, (3) scanner transfer rate to computer is a bit slow - not sure if it is the network interface or a slow processor in the device, and (4) expansion memory is not a popular size, so is more expensive than current PC memory - not sure if I'll upgrade or not. Haven't tried envelopes yet, so can't respond to earlier comments from others. It's kind of entertaining to watch the machine do a duplex copy - as pages in the ADF suck in and out to scan both sides, and pages ejecting come partway out and suck back in to copy the back side\n",

      "We bought this external drive after learning that our friends lost all but a couple months worth of photos and/or videos from their first year with adorable triplet daughters. It resulted from the dreaded and inevitable hard-drive crash that everyone fears, but nobody thinks will happen to them. Attempts by two data recovery firms were unsuccessful and now they're left with whatever printed photos they and their family and friends could find. Expecting our first child in less than three weeks, we don't want to find ourselves in the same predicament, especially with years of other irreplaceable photos, financial data and other documents on our laptop. Now we're doing weekly, monthly and annual [UNK]s and storing some of those offsite to protect against something even worse than a simple crash of a hard drive. Even if we don't completely stick with this new regimen, it's better than what we used to do -- which, though thankfully uneventful, was absolutely nothing. If that's not enough to make you want to buy this, then the [UNK] name, quality, reliability and ease of use should be. The drive is small, stylish, easily installed and takes up little space in the vertical position. Although it's a little loud when the drive is working, it reads and writes CD-R media up to 48x, Ultra Speed Plus CD-RW up to 32x, DVD+/-R up to 16x, and High Speed DVD+RW up to 8x. After a lengthy initial full [UNK] using the included Nero BackItUp software (about 8 GB onto 10 old CD-R discs in 2.5-3.0 hours), smaller differential monthly [UNK]s and incremental weekly [UNK]s to 8x DVD+RW discs take between 10 and 20 minutes each when compressing, copying and verifying everything. [UNK] copies of our 4 GB wedding DVD onto 8x DVD-R discs took about 15-20 minutes. The Nero software seems very extensive, but I haven't used much of it so far. The interface is pretty intuitive and it's easy to find what you want to do, but some of the more detailed or technical options might be overwhelming for someone who's new to this kind of software or doesn't want to spend a lot of time reading the PDF manual. The only real complaint I have is with the BackItUp program's job scheduler, which only gives you daily, weekly and yearly frequency options (you need to set up monthly [UNK]s as weekly jobs and either disable or skip them for several weeks in between months), it takes forever to re-scan files when building a new job on an existing one (setting up subsequent daily, weekly or monthly jobs based on the initial full annual [UNK]), and the data you can change for an existing job is limited (can't rename it or alter the content without creating a whole new job). Overall, great external DVD/CD drive for watching video, listening to music and backing up data. Good software that's intuitive and functional with some room for improvement, but there's no real need for additional software you don't already have. Excellent value -- bought it at Amazon for under $160 with taxes and free shipping, and got a $30 mail-in rebate from [UNK]. Also bought pack of 25 Ritek 8x DVD+RW discs from TheTechGeek.com for $33 delivered and they threw in a free 10-pack of Velocity 8x DVD-R discs.

      "This [UNK] really cleaned up the display image. I had been running another Monster [UNK] - the 6 meter version. I needed the length before because of the way my system was configured. I have a review under that [UNK] about how quality does matter. And so does length. At the time I wrote the review I was just ordering the [UNK] and was posting what I had found out in researching digital video signals. Everything in there stands true. I changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the [UNK] - the 1 meter version - because I could now get away with a much shorter [UNK]. I installed it this morning and the difference, while not earth shattering, was definitely visible. I use this [UNK] to connect between the video card on a media PC and my [UNK] ([UNK] rear-projection [UNK]). The image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows, text, etc., and the image wasn't as clear as I had hoped. While the image looked good, it didn't look great. That's why I decided to take the plunge and spend an extra $79 bucks. The difference is somethine like going from a regular RF feed to your [UNK] and component video [UNK]s. Now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming. It actually brings out detail I couldn't even see before - to the point of deciding to turn on FSAA and filtering so video games have a more realistic look. And that they do. I don't know how other brands compare to the Monster [UNK]s as I haven't tried them. What I do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display. You can get that with high quality [UNK]s and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing. One more thing while I'm here. I want to thank Amazon for going the extra mile on customer service. I had a DVD disappear somehow during shipping. UPS said they delivered it but I never received it. I asked Amazon if they filed the report with UPS or I did to file a claim. What I got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way. That is service. Thanks Amazon\n",

      "Besides the fact that iPod is a skinny little waste of time, let's also mock the fact that it plays about two formats: whatever Mac plays, and [UNK]. Woohoo. What a selection. Then, we have the iAudio. It has perhaps a half inch thickness, at most, over the iPod for the standard battery model (20gb and 30gb anyway; 60gb is as thick as an XL), though it includes so much more bang for your buck, even if some of that bang is kind of useless. But come on; an FM [UNK] isn't iPod standard? Almost every other portable HD player has that by now. About the only thing iPod has over iAudio is movie [UNK], which is, admittedly, better. But I'm fairly basic; I'm buying it for my music, not to watch a bloody movie on a tiny screen. If I want to do that, I'll buy a portable DVD player. For pictures, unless they're ridiculously high [UNK], this suits just fine. But it's not the pictures you should be interested in when buying one of these sweet players; it's the sound [UNK]. Which. Is. Marvelous. It consistantly beats iPod, it has BBE equalizer, and it not plays [UNK] and AAC, but WMA, WAV, OOC, and FLAC. *FLAC.* And if you download Rockbox (which is something you'll have to research on your own, kids), you can create themes, boost your battery life, and augment your listening pleasure even further. The only drawbacks are the battery life if you don't use playlists, skip around a lot, or play high bitrate files (all of which are fixed rather well by Rockbox), and the subpack. What is a subpack? It's a fairly good idea done badly. It's a piece of [...] plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player. In it are the power jack, line-out (which has a bad bass roll-off problem, unfortunately) and line-in jack, and USB port. The general idea was to make the player smaller by moving all of these jacks onto something else, but it wasn't executed too well. Buying a charger from [...].com solves the power jack and USB port problems nicely, and is recommended most highly. (And did I mention recording with the built-in mic is amazing?

I would have liked the option to change the key to the Shut Down / Hibernate dialog instead. I haven't found that option available, so far.

      "This is a direct comparision between the [UNK] [UNK] and TrendNet 509UB. Both perform as expected when used as a standalone hot spot detector. Both perform as expected on Windows XP. Installation was quirky for both. After driver installation, inserting into USB slot it wasn't recognized at all. Fiddled around for awhile and it finally detected the device. Had to disable the notebook's builtin [UNK] before XP recognized the device. Client software does not detect a device under Windows Vista Ultimate RC2. I assume this will be true for Windows Vista RTM too. Inserting the device into a Windows Vista RC2 system often completely froze Windows Vista (had to hold down power button for complete reboot). Had to disable the notebook's builtin [UNK] before Vista recognized the device. Appears that the TrendNet and [UNK] devices are so similar that they must be made by the same OEM or reference design. As expected, evaluation results are similar. 1. Both devices seem to have same sensitivity, similar to notebook's internal [UNK] card. 2. TrendNet device doesn't have Windows XP signed drivers so an extra click during install is requried. Also installing on new USB ports requires extra clicks. 3. TrendNet device supports 801.11a whereas [UNK] does not. 4. TrendNet device sometimes crashes Vista Ultimate RC2. 5. Neither device's software client works under Vista Ultimate RC2. This isn't a deal breaker for me as they both work under Vista Ultimate RC2 networking as a USB [UNK] key. You just lose the client software feature. 6. The [UNK] has a somewhat useful backlit LCD, TrendNet does not. 7. Both devices work as standalone hotspot locators equal well. 8. In hotspot mode, both devices show SSID, channel number, encryption mode, etc. Conclusion: For XP, I recommend the TrendNet so save the extra dollars. For Vista, I recommend the [UNK] device as it never crashed Vista Ultimate RC2 whereas TrendNet device was gave occasional freezes\n",

      "If you're considering the ViaMichelin (under $200 [UNK]), you're probably trying to decide if a [UNK] that is more than $100 cheaper (much more than $100 in some cases) than its competitors is really any good. Honestly, I would have been skeptical too, however, a relative bought one of these units, and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before I decided to purchase one myself. My brief summary is that Yes, this unit is a good [UNK] and a great value. After using mine on a trip, I'd have a hard time justifying the more expensive models when this one works fine. Background: my [UNK] experience is limited to a 7-year old [UNK] III Plus. I had to plan detailed trips on my PC using Mapsource, then upload the [UNK] and routes to the [UNK]. It could be a time consuming process, and because the unit wasn't necessarily user friendly, my wife never learned how to use it. Enter the ViaMichelin. We just went on a weekend trip and had a chance to test the unit. Set-up time for the trip was about a minute - all I had to do was program in the street address of our destination. Now for the rundown. First - what it doesn't do well. a) Using it for the past two weeks (as a test only) around my home town, I was a little disappointed. It never sent me the wrong way, but it didn't always take the best route. Some of the routing issues were because of very new road construction in the area; and in some cases old \"logging\" roads are still in the database where new subdivisions have been built; and it may not calculate what my experience dictates to be the better route. Although this was disconcerting at first, I don't think it is a big deal as you'll see later. b) Macro-directions - i.e. for a several hundred mile trip. It will get you there, and if you're taking a route that involves some smaller roads between towns, this would be a good device if you aren't familiar with the route. But my route this weekend was very simple. Get to the interstate and drive. It didn't pick my preferred route to the interstate, and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four-lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate. (Although it did recover and finally suggest my route as I stubbornly drove \"my way.\") So, for a major trip, I'd recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route. Use this device if you have a lot of mind-numbing turn-by-turn. Now, what it does well: a) voice prompts are great. It doesn't matter that it doesn't say the street names. Turn right in 300 feet is good enough - especially with the map that you can glance at. b) It did great around my destination towns of Charlotte, NC; Gastonia, NC, and Rock Hill, SC. Did it take the best route as I drove from soccer fields, to hotels, to restaurants? I don't know since I wasn't familiar with the areas, but the routes seems to be just fine, they got me exactly where I needed to go, and I never had to look at a road map. And after all, this was the main reason I needed a newer [UNK]. It passed this with flying colors. c) My wife did some of the set-up while in the car. She'll be using this one on her on very soon. d) We wanted to find a particular restaurant, but didn't have the street address. The restaurant was in the Points of Interest database, and it took us right to it. Also, finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great. I also found a feature that was not listed in the 89-page manual. From the [UNK] map, if you touch the screen, it has a \"bypass route\" option. It will give you some distant options (1 mi, 5 mi, etc.) then it will find a bypass route for you. So, if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam, this will route you off the interstate, take you up the road and bring you back on. Obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving, but then it's going to try to turn you around and/or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer. The bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out. In the future, I would like to do a side-by-side comparison w/ a more expensive (borrowed) [UNK]. Also, after more experience, I'd like to update this review. Bottom line: I am glad I bought this unit. I cannot imagine spending $100-$500 more on a more expensive model. Though the higher priced models may have better features, the value for the extra money just isn't there for me\n",

      "Had mine for over half a year now, and after outstanding abuse it performs as well as the day I bought it. I fill it and empty it every month, rarely ever defragging it, back up my PC files and play movies right off it on my [UNK]. Throw it in my backpack, plug and unplug it all day(hotswaping), still with rarely a sign of slowdown, and it barely gets from cool to warm ever(even when its running from inside my backpack). For some reason requires two [UNK] ports on my new PC (high speed [UNK]2.0 ports) when it shouldn't. It runs on one port at school just fine and I have switched the y [UNK] with a regular [UNK] [UNK] with 50% success. I'd buy another one of these in a heartbeat if I ever thought the one I have would run itself out. The fact that it doesn't need an external AC adapter to run on my [UNK]1.1 [UNK] ports(though it does have a hole for a non-included AC adapter)is a blessing. I've even used its double [UNK] cord to run my power hog of an external cd-rom drive(my cd-rom AC doesnt work on both sadly). Might be luck of the draw, HD related items seem to be sometimes, and I've yet to have to try out their customer service. But overall worth every cent spent(especially since I was looking at a 4GB external for $40 before I saw this). Nearly $1 a gig is a great deal.\n",

I wanted a better cable then the composite [UNK] cables that came with my [UNK] but I was not sure about paying the price for these when the [UNK] cables are about half the cost of the Monster Cables. The reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the [UNK] properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the TV almost discouraged me from even buying this product. I decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my [UNK]. I am very happy that I decided to buy these cables. The cable connector fits perfectly into my [UNK], better than the connector on my original [UNK] cables even. The connectors fit nicely onto my TV, they are snug but not too tight. I believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my TV because of the 8-cut turbine connector, which fits better than a standard [UNK] plug. The video and audio from my [UNK] is unbelievable. My [UNK] pushes the video signal to my 32\" LCD HD TV at 480i with these cables. With my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry. Now the graphics are crisp and clear and I only wish I would have bought these sooner. The display from my [UNK] and games fits nicely onto my TV in widescreen now too, before the picture was not centered on my TV and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen. I would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their [UNK] over the stock [UNK] cables. There are other Monster Cable versions for the [UNK] available so choose the one that is right for you, but if you want something that is moderately priced, don't need digital audio via fiber, and the next best thing to HDMI than this is the cable for you. I am going to get the Monster component cables for my [UNK] next so I will be able to hook it up when I don't have HDMI available for it to use. One more thought, be sure to change the video output on your [UNK] from RGB to Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr in the system configuration before hooking up your [UNK] with these cables or it may not work. My TV told me the connection was not supported and I did not have video output until I changed the video output setting on my [UNK]\n",

      "The Lexar JumpDrive Lightning 2GB flash drive has very impressive performance ratings of 160X (24MB/sec) sustained Read and 120X (18MB/sec) sustained Write [UNK] capability. This is one of the very few USB drives that lists the Read/Write [UNK] capabilities. The \"reality\" of flash drives is that the smaller the file size, the slower the transfer rate will be. I ran some tests with the Lightning to see what the transfer rate and the elapsed time is for groups of various file sizes: * 433MB 784 medium files, avg. 550KB 12X 4 min. 3 sec. * 483MB 81 large files, avg. 6MB 54X 59 seconds * 1GB 1 very large file 115X 58 seconds So, even though the Write [UNK] capability of the Lightning is 120X, the transfer rate drops to 12X with medium size files, which is fairly \"real-world\" usage. But, don't let that dissuade you from considering the Lightning: The higher the \"[UNK] capability\" of the device, the better the transfer rate will be and the less time it will take to transfer those smaller files. To prove this point, I took one of my \"great deal\" CF cards (that had no [UNK] ratings) that tops out at 36X Read / 7X Write, and ran two of the same tests: * 433MB 784 medium files 3X 15 min. 10 sec. * 483MB 81 large files 7X 7 min. 48 sec. So, compared to the Lightning, the \"great deal!\" card took nearly 4 times longer to Write the medium files and 8 times longer to Write the large files. So, which is the better deal when you use the device over and over and over... Whether you are shopping for a card or a stick for digital cameras or a USB flash drive, if the performance numbers are not specified, BEWARE! What you might think is a great deal may get you a device with very poor performance that you will regret purchasing. I know, I have several in my drawer. So, my bottom-line advice is: Look for the highest-rated device you can find. Flash devices will last a looong time and our file sizes and amount of data will only grow! So \"future-proof\" your purchase by shopping for a high-rated and large capacity for now and the future. (I have no relationship with Lexar or the Flash memory industry.\n",

      "After enduring the so-so performance of my stock [UNK] headphones, I figured it was time to step up. As I travel constantly, I wanted something that would would block out exterior noise; as a music freak I wanted something that would sound great. After countless hours of research and even more time debating on what brand of headphones to get (UE vs. Shure vs. Etymotics) I bought the Super.fi 5 pros. In the end it was the price, Amazon was selling then for $90 less than the MSRP. Can't beat that. As soon as they were delivered I hooked them up and put them on. They aren't kidding when they tell you to turn your audio device way down. I keep the volume on my [UNK] way down, a fraction of what I kept it at with the stock headphones. The room I was in faces a major road and we had the windows wide open, so to say there was plenty of ambient noise would be an understatement. With the UEs on, it was just me and the music. A fire engine thundered by, normally a painfully annoying experience. Again, the UEs reduced it to the point that I didn't realize the fire engine was coming until I saw it drive by. As for the music. I first played a couple of tracks by Jenny Lewis and the Watson Twins. I immediately noticed elements to the music I never even heard with my other headphones. Jenny Lewis' angelic voice came through so beautifully clear it was like I was listening to them for the first time. Next I put on some Ray Charles. With the UEs, it was like I was there in the front row. The horn section nearly kicked me out of me chair while I discovered that there was indeed a woodwind section. I've read complaints that in ear headphones don't produce enough bass, so I decided to see for myself and played a couple of tracks from Siamese Twin by The Smashing Pumpkins. While I'm not by any means a bass head, I need some bass to enjoy rock albums. I couldn't have been happier with how the UEs performed. The drums in the album (which I've always considered some of the best) came alive. The guitars actually had some balls, but didn't overpower the singing or drums. As is the case when you stick things in your ears for a period of time, your ears are bound to hurt a little. I found this to be the case only for a day or two, after that the UEs fit snugly without any complaint. The only weird thing I encountered had to do with ear wax. My wife, an audiologist, forbids the family from using Q-tips. So after taking the UEs off for the first couple of times, there was a nice deposit left on the tips of the headphones. Like the discomfort, this [UNK] experience only lasted for the first couple of times I used the UEs, and with the supplied [UNK] cleaner it was really a non issue. When there are so many excellent products out there, finding the perfect headphones becomes extremely challenging. I've never tried on Shures or Etymotics, so I can't compare the performance of those headphones and the UEs. What I do know is that I got a really great deal on the best headphones I've ever had. Without a doubt these are the last pair of headphones I will buy for some time.\n",

      "I bought these for my [UNK] after an exhaustive search for a good sounding, compact [UNK] for work and working out at the gym. If you are like me and can't stand all the [UNK] out there, then you need to find another solution. I tried the Premium [UNK] buds at 40 bucks, and the [UNK] Quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks, but they just gave me earaches and I was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight. I read countless reviews of this [UNK] and I can say this is the best sounding under $40 [UNK] out there that won't mess with your hair. (Yes, better than even the [UNK] [UNK]!) If you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player, be prepared to be blown away. Tight, full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids. You don't have to crank them either, they sound rich even at lower volumes. But if you do crank them they don't distort at all. If you have ever tried the [UNK] Quiet comforts at the stores, these sound very similar but with an open air design! The only negative is the comfort. The little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so. I think I'll get used to it. I'd much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs. jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal (which I had). That could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems. Some other reviewers complained about the headband, but it sounds like they were not wearing these right. Once on your noggin, the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head. This keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort. I do not think the headband is too tight, it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place. I might buy a pair of the PX 100's as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading. The PX 100 is the same exact phone in an \"over the head\" design. At $40, I can afford to get both\n",

You simply put the [UNK] into the cleaner with the label side down. Then, you spray the [UNK] cleaner to the [UNK] surface. You only apply one even spray of cleaner. Then, you close the case and make sure the lid is totally closed. Once you have cranked the movable part of the lid about 5 times, you can remove the [UNK] and let it dry completely. Most of the cleaner was absorbed into the [UNK] pad after the recommended 5 rotations. I found that 8 or 9 rotations did the trick. The first time I used this cleaner I was a bit frustrated with it because I noticed little pieces of black foam all over my [UNK]s. Apparently, there is a little piece of foam in the middle that looks like it belongs there and it seems glued down, but once I removed that piece of foam, all was go.

      "I have been putting this television through its paces since I got it a few weeks ago, and it is by far the best TV I have ever owned, and very difficult to beat. The image quality is really good, with bright, vivid colors and wonderful detail, especially for 1080i/p content, but even lower-resolution 720p content, which is what's more commonly-available on OTA HD broadcast, looks phenomenal. I also have an Apple TV hooked up to it, and even though most of my content is encoded at either 360p, 480p, or 720p, it still looks quite good. It does take some time to get the image tuned to perfection, and the default settings are way too bright with too much color saturation boost, and the DNIe processing system actually seems to make some motion effects worse. However, it's very easy to change the settings and see immediately what effect they have. Like all LCDs it does have some slight black point problems; these aren't noticeable for fullscreen 16:9 content, but for older 4:3 content it's pretty obvious that the black isn't pure black. However, this is again tunable. The only thing I really notice which is pretty annoying is that it doesn't do a very good job of upscaling 480i content, such as the output from most video game systems, and for DVDs to look good you really need an upconverting player since even with a progressive-scan player there is a lot of visible [UNK] when the 480p content is scaled up. It's really more a sad reflection on how the previous \"next-generation\" video looks downright primitive by today's standards. The other noticeable issue is that unlike many televisions with digital tuners, it doesn't have an on-screen program guide. My previous TV (also a Samsung) had an on-screen program guide, but it was rather cumbersome to use and took several minutes of scanning every channel to see what was on, and most local channels are pretty inconsistent about providing the EPG information anyway, so it's not really that big of a deal. You can still see the detailed information for the program that's currently showing, so it makes use of EPG, just not as much as it could. This television's tuner is also quite phenomenal. My previous TV required a very carefully-positioned powered antenna which was very sensitive to every little nearby fluctuation, while with this one I only have a piece of wire jammed into the antenna port and I get perfect reception of every local digital station. Another nice improvement over Samsung's older HDTVs is that it has a wide variety of zoom modes which allow you to counteract some of the stupider things that TV stations do (for example, pillboxing a letterboxed 16:9 show, which is very common for widescreen non-HD programming). Also, analog TV stations and source inputs get their audio signals upconverted to digital, so you only need to run a single optical audio connection to your stereo (while previous Samsungs required running both analog and digital cables and switching between the two inputs based on source material). As a PC monitor this is also quite nice. I have a Mac mini hooked up via SVGA cable, and even with an analog signal it looks perfectly sharp and crystal-clear, and of course you can hook it up via [UNK] (with a DVI to [UNK] adaptor) as well. The only gripe there is that the supported resolutions are a bit quaint - at least on analog SVGA the only 16:9 resolution it supports is 1920x1080, which can be difficult for some older systems to handle. However, on [UNK] it should support all the standard HD resolutions. This television may be more expensive than others in its size class, but it also far outshines every other TV I have seen, aside from the newer LN-T4065, which is nearly identical aside from providing a higher dynamic contrast ratio. If you want to only buy one TV which will last for a long time, it would be hard to go wrong with this one\n",

      "I'm a fanatic for duplexing since I move a LOT of paper around, sometimes amounts which I have to carry to court or mail and which weigh several pounds. The Brother is one of the better machines for the price that handles duplexing well, maybe even the best. This particular machine has [UNK] G built-in, but it costs over $100 more than the same machine without [UNK], and for well over $100, you can probably manage to do the same thing cheaper, maybe even better, and for my office, [UNK] is inappropriate. (It also should be stated that if you go outside Briother itself, then the [UNK] combo IS cost-effective. Brother essentially competes here only with itself.) That said, it makes for an elegant solution in the home if you have any sort of barrier to wiring and would like a single piece of equipment to handle everyone's printing if several of you are running off of a [UNK] [UNK]. There are a bevy of bonuses if this machine is otherwise appropriate for you. It's a complete standalone fax/copier if someone in the house doesn't even have any computer at all. I'm a long-time Brother customer, and they've made operation more intuitive for both computer users and standalone. There were a few bugs in earlier machines by Brother (comparable but older machines I've owned, like the 8500 and the 9700) such as faulty out-of-toner warnings, and all of these seem to have been worked out. This machine is clearly out of beta. Earlier machines were difficult (though not impossible) to set up and use advanced functions without using your manual, and this machine is far better on that aspect as well. You can have faxes arrive two-sided, which doubles your paper tray effectively, and you can scan or fax a two-sided document just by feeding it in and possibly altering a setting. This last is made possible by the physical arrangement and just as much by the aforementioned ease-of-use - you wouldn't use the feature much if you had to do major messing around with menus just send out a two-sided page. Unfortunately, the one bane of all printers which is slightly worse with the Brothers is the \"ink\" aspect. Unlike some competitors, you have to replace a toner AND a drum, and at differing intervals. I assume they do this to keep the costs low, but the costs still aren't particularly low. The non-[UNK] version of the basic machine sells for a little over $400, and there is no problem spending that much for just a couple of drums and a few toners. I don't understand why printers of all sorts cannot just have a \"gas tank\" you could fill with cheap ink and then just add paper, but in most instances, the consumables are the tail wagging the dog in terms of buying a printer. The Brother is a superbly-functioning modern machine at a great price, but don't imagine the price ends when you buy it. This is true of all printers, however, and the news with most printers is worse than here\n",

Now this review should be taken with a grain of salt, because I have only had the [UNK] for a few weeks, but I feel that the results were evident immediately and the build does seem adequate. The reason that I was in search of a [UNK] was due to my dangerously hot hard drive temps. I installed Notebook Hardware Control (free [UNK] and power control utility) after feeling how hot my new notebook was getting and saw temps as high as 55C at my hard drive! Worried about how this would affect the hard drive's longevity, I started looking around at [UNK]s. I choose this [UNK] after reviewing several of the \"mat\" variety, but chose this one because of its design. As the previous reviewers have already mentioned, this [UNK] elevates the notebook from the rear and blows air under the notebook. This allows the CPU fan intake and hard drive to receive plenty of fresh air. After setting this [UNK] up, I was feeling pretty good about the purchase. Qualitatively, the results are evident by a [UNK] notebook top and keypad, and the feel of air exiting the sides of the notebook.

I suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any [UNK] newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as M Audio states....it is program and play, however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless.

      "Wow, I'm surprised by the reviews made here about this product. Despite the bad reviews, I bought it anyway. I still believe in a [UNK]. Guess what? Not bad. I bought this phone set and 4 of its satellites to replace my Siemens. The Siemens was the best phone when it first came out about 5 years ago. This [UNK] phone has the features most people will ever need. The shared [UNK] is very valuable. A loud [UNK] on each [UNK] is priceless. Incoming and outgoing sound quality is excellent. I don't understand why there are several reviews here stating the phone has bad sound quality. Ok, the range is not as good as my 2.4ghz phone but it is not bad for someone with an average size home. After about 75 meters with 3 walls in between, I can start to hear the voice I'm speaking to, crackles. I just did this for test but I can get clear voice anywhere in my 4 bedroom house. I am running a 2ghz wi-fi and do not hear any interference. With regard to the [UNK], I wish I can enter more characters each address! The maximum characters I can enter is only 11. I think I can enter about 20 on my Siemens. Another minor quirk is when someone called, I could just lift the phone off its charging base and start talking to the other party. Not with this phone. I still have to press the \"flash\" bottom everytime before I can start talking. Build quality is excellent. It is a little on the heavy side which I like probably because it uses 4 rechargeable batteries and made of thick plastic. Even if I squeeze the [UNK] hard, I didn't hear that plasticky noise and feeling of the plastic warping. I tried the Pana, V-Tech, Uniden, GE, and ATT in a local store and the [UNK] is tops. You will not see a rubbery wiggly buttons here. I personally think this is the best phone among the few remaining brands around. If you do not see it that way, it must be a quality defect that can happen on any product.\n",

Plus if anything does happen in the first 90 it is fully returnable to Target. Good Deal all around. Highly reccomended.\n",

      "I wanted a simple [UNK] so I could [UNK] a few [UNK]s from time to time to hand out. On sale for $50, this seemed like the right one. I already had the included Zoombrowser and Photo Stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a [UNK] A95 camera, so I just needed to install the driver. Note this requires a USB cable (not included) to the [UNK]. As is human nature, I tried to [UNK] without reading the Zoombrowser instructions, and got a lovely plain sky-blue [UNK] with the words \"My Album\" on it - but no photo :-) Then, out came a stunning second [UNK] which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines - this was from a residual click from my first attempt. Ok, Ok, so I looked at the PDF [UNK] guide for about 15 seconds, and followed the instructions. Got a beautiful first [UNK] of the Queen Mary ship. Got a gorgeous second [UNK] of flags (red/white/blue, and green) againt a clear blue sky, and the third [UNK] was very nice of a field of flowers near Mt Lassen (ironically the original proof [UNK] of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper [UNK]s...) So, I've blown through the provided \"trial\" 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge, and have 3 very nice [UNK]s (with postcard address lines, stamp area and [UNK] logo on the back - the paper comes that way.) The ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1/2 inch from the end so you can remove them after [UNK]. I can't compare the [UNK] software to any other brand, but setting up a plain photo-only [UNK] takes about 10 seconds of menu choices. If you want to add backgounds, titles/text, etc, that is available as well. (Got another pack of paper/film, and put humorous captions on kind of funny-bad office Christmas pix...) [UNK] directly from my A95 takes about the same time as from the computer - about 1 min 45 sec. The actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the [UNK] 4 times (3 color passes and a protective layer) so it is important the back of the [UNK] is not obstructed, particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot. The finished [UNK] is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front. The unit looks and feels substantial for its small size, comes well packed (survived NY to CA shipping), has decent documentation, and a 1-year warranty.\n",

Good news: it worked, and a few hours after I started, I was watching the [UNK] I created, on my bedroom [UNK] player. Bad news: the software is full of minor and sometimes more than minor annoyances. It may be that I'm still climbing the learning curve with it, but I think it's just not very good. I'm looking into other solutions, such as Pinnacle, Adobe Premiere Elements, etc. Meanwhile, I keep spooling. I haven't yet tried the TV capture in any depth.

      "The reviewer below identifying himself as \"An Electronics Fan\" obviously has a deep bias against [UNK]. His multiple reviews about [UNK] products--here and elsewhere--are transparently motivated by some animus against [UNK]. Was he fired by [UNK]? Did a member of the [UNK] family reject his romantic advances? Did a [UNK] executive accidentally run over his cat? Did he drop a [UNK] [UNK] on his foot and hurt his toe? The true motivation for this guy's negative reviews would be fun to know. In the meantime, what we do know is that he has no credibility, and his reviews (two here, others elsewhere for other [UNK] products; he's made maligning [UNK] his life's work, apparently)) should disregarded. I bought a set of black 301's several years ago to go with my Onkyo receiver. We have it hooked up to a television and DVD player for movies. These [UNK]s are in constant use both for the DVD and for music of all types. The room in which they are placed is huge, with an 18 foot-high flat ceiling. The [UNK]s saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day. The [UNK]s work fine for spoken [UNK] for DVD's; we can hear dialogue perfectly; I feel no particular need for a surround-sound system. Several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto. I feared a ruptured [UNK] cone, but the 301's are very forgiving, no damage has been done. The cats sleep on the [UNK]s; they clean right up and still look new after five years. These [UNK]s keep on giving total satisfaction, and I quite simply love them. About three years ago I decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market, or at least what I determined to be best after a lot of research. This included a set of the gold-series tower [UNK]s from Monitor [UNK]. (The [UNK] cones are metallic, with some amount of gold, and gold connections, etc., etc.) These Monitor [UNK]s have to be the best looking [UNK]s ever made (real wood veneer cabinetry, with the gold cones and the black covers, etc.). These [UNK]s cost well over a thousand dollars each. Well, I must confess, as awesome as the Monitor [UNK]s sound, I can't really say they sound any better than the [UNK] 301's!!! They can maybe handle more power, but I assure you the [UNK] 301's will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less. So, when I recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom, I looked forward to buying a third type of [UNK]s. I ran around and listened to what I could find on display. Well, after much contemplation, I went for a second set of the [UNK] 301's!!! They just couldn't be beat, and I would have gladly spent more if I had found something I liked better. But I'm not going to spend more just so I can say I spent a lot...there has to be increased performance. And, in my opinion, the 301's couldn't be out-performed by any other bookshelf [UNK] of any price range. My first set of 301's were black. This time I went for the cherry. Folks, these are absolutely beautiful [UNK]s: almost as cool looking as my Monitor [UNK]s. The black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood. No, it is not real wood, but it looks very nice. These things are simply gorgeous. The kind of \"mod\" or futuristic shape which [UNK] has designed really stands out in this lighter-colored version. And, yes, they sound just as good as my original pair. I listen to soft music (jazz, typically, or ambient) in the morning and these [UNK]s deliver all the nuances at very low volume; I listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions, and the 301's don't scare away or distort at all: these things would tear the house apart before they'd lose sound quality. So, yes, I recommend these highly. They'd still be the [UNK] of choice for me at three or four times the price\n",

The call took about 2 minute and the replacement part was already on its way, they definetly stand by and back up their warranty. No problems with the second unit and If I ever need another one I would still buy a lenmar. The two middle charging slots supposed to work only on lenmar PPRO-H batteries, one can use the slot number 1 and 4 for regular NiMH batteries, it charges regular high capacity batteries to an 80% level in less than 15 minutes, and the other PPRO-H batteries in about 7-8 minutes. I didn't notice difference between my rechargeable energizer batteries and the the PPRO-H batteries, but the PPRO-H kind are more durable. This [UNK] is the best in its category because it support worldwide voltage 110-240 V and the first to use NeoTherm® charging technology! it's solid and heavy duty [UNK], not like the cheap kind that are everywhere.

I can barely read what each [UNK] does because the labels/print is also VERY tiny. This is annoying when in my daughter's darkened room and I have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause [UNK]... the other thing I have to point out that bugs me is that you can't eject/or open the [UNK] player unless the [UNK] is in [UNK] mode. In other words when I go to put in a [UNK], I can't just push \"open\". Nothing will happen. You have to find the right [UNK], choose \"[UNK]\" from a choice of 3-4 things, and only then will the tray slide open. All in all, these things would not prevent me from buying this [UNK] again...although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly [UNK] with bigger [UNK]s/symbols for a small child to recognize... One great thing I want to point out--there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards (something not all [UNK] players offer) and this is great when you are putting a [UNK] in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads....you can FF right to the beginning of the movie!!!\n",

The interface is intuitive and the [UNK] is amongst the best I've ever used on this type of device. Moreover, the access times for [UNK] and Thesaurus lookups are very fast; the \"phrase search\" function is a little bit slower, but not intolerable. There are also \"crossword puzzle\" and \"anagram solver\" functions that I have not used, but I imagine work fine. Another positive for this product is the fact that it uses a single AAA battery, not some watch-type cell battery.

      "This item is [UNK], which also called RS model vs. the [UNK] called XS models. External battery [UNK] can be used for both [UNK] and [UNK]. The capability to connect external battery is great, since that can help reduce the downtime when California experiencing \"rolling black\" in the summer. There are basically 2 differences between the Back-[UNK] RS([UNK]) and the Back-[UNK] XS ([UNK]) models besides their names. 1. The Back-[UNK] RS models have both 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem data-line protection and 10/100base-T ethernet protection, where as the Back-[UNK] XS models only has 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem protection. 2. The Back-[UNK] RS models have both Boost* and Trim** as features of Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR), where as the Back-[UNK] XS only has Boost. When the input voltage increases above the high transfer point of a Back-[UNK] XS model it will only go to battery. *AVR Boost: The [UNK] is compensating for a low utility voltage. While the [UNK] can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the [UNK], the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently low. **AVR Trim: The [UNK] is compensating for a high utility voltage. While the [UNK] can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the [UNK], the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently high. [UNK] does not have the AVR trim feature, when AC line voltage is higher than spec, it will switch over the battery power till the line voltage drops into the spec range. Please note this is called \"[UNK] [UNK]\", not the \"smart [UNK]\" line. [UNK] [UNK] does not produce pure sine wave. When power lost, it will take some milli-seconds to switch over to battery power. \"Smart-[UNK]\" produces sine wave and the output AC was from DC source all the time. When AC input lost, the AC output will not have any interrupt. For most computers, the \"[UNK]-[UNK]\" is good enough, since the power supply inside PC always have capacitors that can hold for about 100MS or longer. When \"[UNK]-[UNK]\" switched over in about 20MS, the computer will continue operates without much impact. But for A/V equipment, this may be an issue, especially the output is not pure sine wave. I would not recommend use this [UNK] for A/V equipment\n",

My old iBook survived tremendous abuse, and after two years looked like it had been through a war. The Speck case protects the [UNK]Book's shell and even the screen, in a roundabout way. Normally, if you put a [UNK] into a briefcase or bag with heavy books, the books will press against the shell, and the screen inside will press against the keys leaving dents and screwing the the LCD. The Speck case is very stiff, so even the heaviest books and the worst abuse don't push the screen onto the keyboard. Plus, if you put a red case on a white [UNK], people will think you're in some secret club that has access to red [UNK]s. Cons: it's next to impossible to remove the top case with two hands - you need a buddy to get it off.

It's a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations. You turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago. I wouldn't mind the analog [UNK] too much if it at least had a handful of presets. This also makes the remote control somewhat useless too. Oddly, the remote does have an AM/FM button. They should just label it the \"Radio\" button, because when you think of it, switching from AM to FM or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re-tune the station too, using the dial. Another key point is that the unit doesn't have any outputs at all. So you can't pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers. I would rate this as 3.5 stars, but since we can't use half stars, I'll give it 4 for one big reason.... For all it's shortcomings, it works, and there are very few alternatives. Speaking of alternatives, here are a few other options. 1. A standalone CD-[UNK]. I have one of these too. The advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old [UNK] deck. In my case, my stand alone unit has two drives, so not only can I record from any source in my system, but I can dub from one drive to the other. Also, my deck can make MP3 CDs from regular CDs (It's easier than using a PC, however the song titles are just numbers). In my case, I opted not to use this for my LP projects, because I no longer have a turntable. I decided that as long as I needed a new turntable, I might as well pay a bit more for this unit. 2. Crosley makes a simuilar unit, but it costs a bit more and the reviews I read seemed to point out that although it looks better, the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot. 3. A portable digital [UNK] like the iKey Plus. I found one of these a few weeks ago and I love it. You plug your turntable or other external source into it... plug a USB storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality (.WAV vs several MP3 sampling rates)... Viola! It records directly to your flash drive, iPod or external hard drive. If you do go that route, make sure you get the \"Plus\" model. The older model is outdated and doesn't work as well. 4. Use a PC. Even though it will give you the best possible sound and options, it's out of the question for me because I do not want to move my PC near my stereo every time I want to make a [UNK], nor do I want to move my stereo next to my PC... or bog it down while I'm trying to use it for that matter. Keep in mind that if you record your CDs using one of the stand alone decks, you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the CDs you made into a PC afterwards, then filtering the files with your favorite [UNK] software, then re-burn the files to CD or MP3.\n",

It powered up, great windshield adapter, no problems with the connections, bluetooth works perfectly, Ipod controls - no problem. Just one thing, NO [UNK] FIX !! It would not lock on - even after one hour in the open sky. I thought, here goes....bad tech support....ship it back... But no. I called tech support, got through to a human (very knowledgable) in only 20 seconds. Problem was fixed by upgrading [UNK] and the unit works perfectly. I read on many sites of the problems plaguing these units. Apparently, they have all the bugs out because every aspect, every feature is cool and workable. The TomTom Go-510 is highly recommended in my book and mad props to the tech support crew - way to roll\n",

      "I had looked at numerous [UNK]s for my [UNK] [UNK] and didn't want to spend a ton of money for a professional grade [UNK] (at professional prices). With that in mind, the [UNK] [UNK] Double X Portable [UNK] [UNK] is a good choice at $29.99. I had seen other [UNK]s that were not as sturdy (single X [UNK]s)and cost about the same price. Tips for assembly: - Don't read the instructions, just look at the enlarged image of the [UNK] on Amazon and assemble the [UNK] the way it's shown. - The bolts for attaching the arms and legs come screwed in to the [UNK]. Use the (included )Allen Wrench to remove them. PROS: - Low price. - Solid, sturdy [UNK]. - Works for just about any [UNK]. - The [UNK]'s height is fully adjustable, and can be done in several seconds - without having to unscrew anything. CONS: - There is no way to attach a [UNK] to this [UNK]. No screws, bolts or straps are included, even though most (including my [UNK]) [UNK]s have pre-drilled holes for screwing the board to a [UNK]. The [UNK] simply sits on top of the [UNK]. I was VERY disappointed about this. - The included Allen wrench did not work for one of the bolts. The bolt came screwed in to the [UNK] way too tightly to be removed using the included tool. The Allen Wrench only stripped the bolt, it did not loosen it. Luckily my husband had a better Allen Wrench of nearly identical size, and that one worked. Without it, we would not have been able to loosen the bolt\n",

      "I gave my son a [UNK] 60C for Christmas last year. Tinkered with it for a couple of days before handing it over. It worked well. Of course I wanted one for myself, but cash is cash, so I've been putting it off. (Side note - I wanted to borrow it for a trip this past spring, and when they went to get it, it had been stolen from their car map-pocket. It seems these are high-theft items; keep'em on a short leash.) My wife hadn't gotten me any \"big\" Christmas gift, so I told her I knew what I wanted, and started shopping. I debated between the eXplorist 500 and 600. Chose the 600, with its altimeter and thermometer. Probably could have lived without them, but hey, it's Christmas! It came yesterday, so I charged it a bit, and then it had no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover. I had to go out to the street for the [UNK] to find satellites. Took it out for a spin today. Spot-on navigation as I ran errands. It tracked back almost to the exact spot I had marked for home, though it had me driving down the wrong side of the street on that portion of my route that was a duplicate - so it's off by a few feet. (Maybe it still thinks it's in Britain?) Now - why only 4 stars? 1) the USB connector can attach to the unit either way. There's no instructions anywhere to say which way it should go. I called the 800 # and spoke with someone (in New Delhi) who had heard this a lot. She told me what to do, and the PC immediately recognized the [UNK] file system - as a removable disk drive, as advertised. I really find their Website information near-zero. Something as elementary as this should be covered on a Website after the 3rd call, eh? 2) I bought the Mapsend 3D Topo software. I am interested in elevations. And it has detailed street maps. BUT - they're not routable! If you want routable streets (where the unit will route you along streets and not just a crow's flight direct path) for following in a car, then either you have to get both map products, or choose. It's rather frustrating. And the sales information provided on Amazon and the [UNK] sites does not make this critical lack very clear. It tells you what you can do, but not what you can't and there's no product comparison to see what the differences are. On the Mapsend Topo box, it says very clearly, \"NAVTEQ roads and streets data - like that found in the most expensive car navigation systems (non-routable)\". Er, excuse me, then it's not quite like that found in expensive car systems, is it? I concur with other reviewers who find the software selection verbiage (on Amazon and [UNK]) more obfuscating than informative. Why can't someone create a simple comparison chart for all the various map packages\n",

The manual (electronic file) advises \"Never [UNK] on the same sheet of labels more than once or [UNK] on a partial sheet of labels.\" So it's a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label. A wonderful quality of experience is the near \"instant on\" (very minimal warmup) feature and it's quiet. My previous Okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before [UNK]ing.

      "The only thing I will say about the [UNK]-S1 is that it is top quality. Picture and sound quality are top-notch, but everything really depends on the software. Now, if you are undecided about which camp to follow ([UNK]-ray or HD DVD), I'm here to tell you that [UNK]-ray will win. You see, I have both [UNK]-ray and HD DVD. I have about 20 HD DVD movies and about 20 [UNK]-ray movies. In terms of picture and sound quality, they are the same, but it is completely dependant on the software. But here is where the similarities end. 1) [UNK]-ray is more durable. The BD movie [UNK]s have scratch-resistant coating. They don't scratch unless you forcefully scratch them. On the other hand, the [UNK] movies scratch like heck. I put all of my movies in a CD case. I recently noticed that ALL the [UNK] movies are scratched, but NONE of the [UNK]-ray movies are scratched. These are stored in the SAME CD case by me. I am extremely careful. None of my movies even have a fingerprint on them. So when I see scratches on 100% of my [UNK] movies, that really upsets me!!!!! 2) [UNK]-ray costs less to BUY. What? Superman Returns BD is $24, Superman [UNK] is $28. The Departed BD is $24, The Departed [UNK] is $28. Now the [UNK] DUAL format has both a standard DVD and [UNK] movie, but who in their right mind would want to buy an [UNK] to watch a 480p picture? Right now you can get a $500 PS3 or $400 Toshiba [UNK] player. Later this year, Sony will come out with a $300 [UNK]-Ray [UNK] player. [UNK] will most likely drop their prices. So the hardware will cost the same in both formats. 3) [UNK]-ray has more capacity. For less money, you can get a 50GB [UNK]-ray movie versus a 30GB [UNK] movie. And what if in 5 years they develope SUPER High-Definition 1920p picture and SUPER Hi-Def 8.1 DTS-HD Sound? What if this requires 75GB or 100GB? [UNK] can go up to 51GB. Peace.\n",

      "I use my [UNK] 2.1 system as my desktop PC [UNK]s. I got this recommendation from Maximum PC, since the [UNK] 5.1 system was 2005's best [UNK] system. You can view their gear of the year review here: http://www.maximumpc.com/2005/12/m-audio_studiop_1.html. Being skeptical of a $550 5.1 system with only 27 watts to each satellite, I wanted to start slow and only ordered the 2.1 system. As soon as I purchased cables (FYI: no 1/8\" [UNK] to two 1/4\" mono cables seem to exists -as far as I've seen--, so you have to use adaptors) I was blown away by the crisp flowing sounds of the [UNK]s. I wasn't used to [UNK]s with crossovers, where only the each type of [UNK] (tweeter, woofer, and sub) gets the right frequencies, so no overlapping exists. All the sounds are crystal clear and the housings is very dense and resilient, while the [UNK]s themselves are of superb build quality. After only a few hours of listening to many kinds of music and playing sound-intensive games, I immediately hopped back online and ordered myself the 5.1 expander setup. If you are looking for [UNK]s that play really loud, or can fill a living room with the desired feel for an action movie, these are not for you. But if you want incredibly accurate PC [UNK]s or relatively cheap studio monitors this is definitely the setup for you. You will not be disappointed if you buy the [UNK] for your bedroom or for computer use\n",

      "We now have three of the [UNK] [UNK]s in use, one with a built in print server, second paper tray, and duplexer. So far, the [UNK]s have proved to be reliable, fast, and comparatively inexpensive to operate. Power on, pre-print, and post-print noise may be objectionable to users who are located close to the [UNK]. Capable of using the same HP 10 black and HP 11 individual color ink cartridges, as well as replacement print heads as the HP Business Ink Jet 1100d and HP Business Ink Jet 1200d, the [UNK] shares the same low, per page operating cost as the 1100d and 1200d [UNK]s. Full page color photographs print in roughly 32 seconds, with a roughly eight second delay prior to the start of [UNK]; similar prints from other [UNK]s may require from one to five minutes to print the same full page color photograph. White horizontal lines were present in the full page color photograph, possibly indicating that one or two of the nozzles in the print heads, shipped with the new [UNK], are defective. The [UNK] handles paper sizes up to 13\" x 19\", so it easily handles B size (tabloid, 11\" x 17\") paper commonly used for small engineering prints and foldable newsletters. The [UNK] software installs without problem, although a reboot will likely be required. For network capable [UNK] [UNK]s, the software install automatically finds [UNK] [UNK]s on the network, and adds a \"HP Standard TCP/IP Port\" to the computer configuration for communication with the [UNK]. For non-network capable [UNK] [UNK]s, both USB and parallel port connections are supported. Positives: * Uses ink that is compatible with other [UNK] models, helping to keep operating costs down. * Fast [UNK] for full page color, and even faster black [UNK] with spot color. * Large format color [UNK], which is helpful for quick generation of engineering prints. * Nearly idiot proof print cartridge replacement - light turns on to indicate the color that needs to be replaced, [UNK] stops automatically, user replaces ink cartridge, and [UNK] continues. * Separate ink cartridges and print heads means less aligning of print cartridges/heads after ink cartridge replacement, larger capacity ink cartridges, and lower operating cost. Negatives: * Minimal install of HP software from the CD requires at least 100MB. * Low capacity HP 13 print cartridges ship with the [UNK]. * Power-on, pre-print, and post-print noise, just like the Business Ink Jet 1100d and 1200d. However, there is very little noise produced while [UNK]. * Cheap plastic cover over the print cartridges, similar to that used on the 1200d. * Large footprint\n",

      "I must admit, the first review posted here on the [UNK] made me a little nervous. My experience is quite different, and after several months of ownership I am quite pleased. I'll give a point by point rebuttle to the initial review, as that's the only point of reference (so far): 1) Yes, pick up a USB cable, 2) [UNK] driver installation on Win98 essentially required no user intervention. With WinXP however, I do seem to recall having to muck with it more, but I'm hazy on the details now, 3) I have printed scores of multi-page documents, many over 15 pages without any problems whatsoever. I've had no spills or jams of any kind, 4) I have not seen any \"paper-curl\" problems whatsoever, 5) I leave the paper cassette lid/manual-feed slot in place at all times as I have no problem with it. For doing many two-sided copies, it is indeed easier to place the copies back into the paper cassette. But that's my experience with any copier I've used. 6) Making two-sided copies is easy and as efficient as I expected. I've simply experienced no problems. 7) I've experienced no copier caused misalignments. If my copies have been crooked, it was because I set them on the glass improperly. I am very happy with this unit. It copies as I expect it to, and prints just the same: quickly and without event. It's been able to properly print from all Windoze applications I've thrown at it, and ones many users may not even be using, such as Ghostscript, Acrobat, SecureCRT, PAF, and all image viewing software I've tried. And I've got several machines networked together (Win98 and WinXP) that can all print to the [UNK] fine using [UNK] sharing.

      "I had researched for a long time before I finally made my purchase. The final reasons for this purchase was the Consumer Reports Best Buy recommendation for the larger 42\" version of this Olevia set. I had debated about purchasing a [UNK] with 1080 but decided against doing so when I read that in a set this size that the naked eye could not tell the difference between 1080 and 720. I needed the 37\" set due to the entertainment center we already owned, which cost 2.5 times the price of the [UNK], so it wasn't leaving the house. The [UNK] opening would have allowed a 40\" but I am glad I stayed with the 37\" because the set-up would have been difficult if not impossible with a 40\" because of the need to turn the set at angles. I compared the two [UNK]s at the Olevia site and the only difference was the speakers. I also saw the Olevia at a friend's house and was impressed with the quality. The best price was found through Amazon.com. I placed my order on a Friday evening and the set was delivered by UPS in perfect condition on Wednesday. The set-up of the [UNK] was simple. The only problem I experienced was with the remote. Here's the good news: I sent an email to tech support and quickly I had an answer that was simple to follow and the remote worked perfectly the same evening that I set-up the [UNK]. Even though I use the surround sound through our stereo, I actually was satisfied with the sound through the [UNK] speakers. A small problem is that the Time Warner Cable Box remote control does not operate the [UNK], so we do have to use multiple remotes, but that's only a minor inconvenience.

      "I purchased the [UNK] because I don't have an aux input in my car. The product works well. I live in an area that is crowded with stations and the [UNK] still provided a strong enough signal to override weak stations and provide near quality [UNK]. One review mentioned the [UNK] player won't fit in the [UNK] with the silicon case on. I use the silicon case to protect my player. I took off the belt clip that comes with the case. The player and case fits well enough in the [UNK].\n",

I plan on getting more as needed. When they get full, it still stays sturdy and fits in the [UNK] (the other one I purchased ballooned out and had to be forced to get it in).

During the operational time, I saw that I don't have good [UNK]. I don't know if the reason is because this distance between my office and my living-room (the office is above from the living-room - so there is no big distance at all).

If you are using the [UNK] in colder temperatures the [UNK] will need to sit and warm up before use. Apparently there is some type of a dew [UNK] built in. Also if you are transferring images from a [UNK] you have to look at the manual to determine what type of [UNK] is required. Not a one [UNK] does all [UNK]\n",

Found that the [UNK] drivers provided by [UNK] for the [UNK] would not work with the Microsoft [UNK]. Seems still some incompatibility with different manufactures of [UNK] devices. Go figure.... Had to delete the [UNK] drivers and let XP with SP-2 provide the drivers and it works great. Pros: Great features, no cord, long battery life between charges (days), very responsive.

      "When I got my hands on the PMC-120 I thought this was going to to be the best player but when I started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way. I agree with the other reviews that it has a first generation-device feel to it. MUSIC: When I tried to put music in my PMC it syncronized my [UNK]s with the [UNK] 10 with no problem (very fast). If U are looking for a grab and drop (copy/paste) your music [UNK] device, this is not for you because when I did it got everything in one same folder that read \"Unknown artist and album\". So you have to put all your [UNK]s via [UNK] 10, wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast. The problems that I encountered is that it only has one \"Portable [UNK]\" and sometimes when Im playing an [UNK] and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button. One cool thing is that it shows the cd covers without having to put them in. This is done via the [UNK]. The sound is very good and crisp, and the equalizer setups are fair.But you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound. PICTURES: This is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders. You can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a PC to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you. VIDEO: Ok, now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me... I wanted a portable media device that I would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid. I knew that this device only reads WMV but it \"supports\" DIVX, XVID, MPEG, etc. This \"support\" deppends on what the [UNK] can play. So this means that you sincronyze (via [UNK]) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into [UNK] movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your PMC secreen size. I had this in mind when I bought it and was fine with me untill I tried it the first time: The [UNK] wouldnt convert my XVID movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that I had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the [UNK]. So after uninstalling and installing I was good to go so I converted a 1:45hr long movie in only 25 minutes. But this short moment of joy was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the [UNK] fits the widescreen movies into the PMC and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable!!!! You cant change this because the [UNK] does this automatically. My answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into WMV files. The problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert...I have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the [UNK]. In the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the [UNK] and it does it very fast and with good quality. You can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so I think this option is useless on the PMC. So the veredict is: The PMC-120 is a good multimedia player with minor glitches. It is a little bulky but personally I think the size is not that big. I think the good side of the size issue comes along with its big 3.6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video. If you want to play directly your DIVX or XVID movies on your player buy another porduct like the iRiver PMP series or the Archos players wich are way, way, WAY more expensive. So I think that for the price and for what it does the PMC-120 gets two thumbs up.\n",

The sound of the fan is about as loud as a fan from a PC workstation (one of those DELL Precisions or MacPro/PowerMacs). One of the things I wish could be different about the unit is if the [UNK] configuration could be more easily managed by using Apple's Disk Utility instead of using WD's own proprietary software (which requires a reboot... an annoying thing on Mac [UNK].4 which I almost NEVER EVER have to reboot). And then the button manager requires yet another reboot before the functionality can be fully utilized... HELLO, Western Digital... Mac is no Microsoft Windows where users are used to rebooting often! If you want more of Mac users' business, write your apps like a true [UNK] app...

Also, I have read about some workarounds for the [UNK] ordering problem, but they involve rebuilding your library, and furthermore from what I've read they're just temporary fixes. Apple needs to fix this. Still, the small form factor, cool design, and easy-to-use controls make this a great product. I sold my 4G 40GB iPod right after I got this, and I have no regrets.\n",

      "The design for this [UNK] is ingenious. Every piece is separated so you can mix and match for your convenience. It's not really a [UNK], but a [UNK] with a detachable [UNK]; so you can use it to chat online or listen to your mp3 player. The [UNK] can even be mounted independently onto your computer monitor with the included base. The extension cord comes with a volume controller, another very convenient feature. There are also little hangers on the extension cord, which are for attaching the [UNK] cord. The audio quality is pretty good, throw in 20 bucks more to get the combo set, which includes a sound card to enhance the audio quality. ****The only thing I have to complain about is the comfort issue. Maybe it's the size of my head, but the earpieces simply press a little bit too hard against my temples, so it causes mild headache after 30 minutes of usage. Other than that, this [UNK] is perfect\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstoff, that first review about the format capacities is outright wrong. Let me explain how this works. The soundstage program that the player uses is a lot like iTunes; it has its own proprietary format that is really just [UNK] with a different file extension title. When you import your [UNK]s into the soundstage library, it makes its own DUPLICATE library of your music in a new directory using its 'OMG' file suffix. Yes, OMG. I think that's funny, and you should too. The [UNK] themselves are essentially just CD-RWs. Keep this in mind. They are enjoyable cheap to buy more, they are rewritable, and they hold 80 minutes of basic cd-audio, or close to 4/5 hours of 'low bitrate' audio, which is just compressed [UNK]s. The product itself is very good. I've had one for a short while. I bought an eight-pack of disks right after I got it, and filled them with music. I have six full discs of labeled artists and find that disc-swapping of five-hour playlists is FAR less irritating than my old cd-player method; CD-swapping with 70-minute albums. The controls are VERY simple and effective. Grouping your tracks makes them easier to navigate, but you can otherwise go through all the tracks you have as if it were an audio-CD. Its impeccably shockproof, and my only severe grievance is the lack of a backlight. The hold switch works fine and the unit is small and light. I got this as an alternative to harddrive [UNK] jukeboxes. Most [UNK] players over a gig in capacity are HD storage, which is far less durable (in my experience) than simpler players. Rather than settle for a 256 or 512 mb player that I would have to swap on my computer constantly, I got the [UNK] player and can simply take other disks with me. Its a solution that suited me well\n",

      "I installed this unit on my HP AMD 64 X2 with a 19-inch [UNK] [UNK]. Installation was very straightforward, with no problems experienced. The unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total. All are surge protected, but only one row has battery backup. Each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets. The unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line, and interacts well transparently my DSL service. The unit comes with a USB connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer. Also included is \"PowerChute Personal Edition\" software. This software replaces the UPS option used under the \"Power\" icon of Widow's XP Control Panel. PowerChute PE allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user's needs. PowerChute PE automatically loads at computer startup, and resides as an icon on the right-side of the Window's task bar. It [UNK]s the unit's status, and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference. In order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly, I only attached the PC and [UNK] to the powered row of outlets. Transformers seem to use a lot of power, and to gain the most time available for adequate shut-down times they should only be plugged into the \"surge only\" outlet row. When A/C power fails, the unit immediately picks up the power load. It will then begin to shut down the PC if A/C power does not become available shortly . The default method it uses is to place the PC into \"hibernation mode\", saving the desktop exactly \"as is\" for future start-up. It accomplished this task with my PC perfectly. If I had wanted a UPS to keep my computer running for several minutes during an A/C power outage, this is not the unit I would have purchased. However, to keep my system from re-booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily, or to shut down the PC safely should the power outage last longer, this is a cost-effective solution for those tasks.\n",

I opted for the smallest in the range for value, and was not disappointed, but I am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger [UNK] would be better, but at cost.

      "Title: Intuos3 [UNK] Publisher: [UNK] Publish Date: Unknown ISBN/Model #: PTZ631W Reviewer: Robert Saucier Rating: 5 stars In 1997, after buying a new top-of-the-line 450MHz [UNK]tium II system, I splurged on a [UNK] ArtZ II [UNK]. Oh, my! Pressure-sensitive, tilt-sensing, pointer control, assignable function pads; it was Heaven. After a couple of years, every time I tried to use it with my primary graphics application, my computer would spontaneously reboot -- a bit counter-productive. I watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but, as technology marched on, my beloved [UNK] and graphics application continued their spats. Sadly, I disconnected the [UNK] and gently packed it away. Lately, I've been feeling the pull once more, that urge to use a [UNK] to do photo touch-ups instead of my mouse. Miraculously, a [UNK] Intuos3 6-inch by 11-inch [UNK] dropped, almost literally, into my lap. Sleek, gun-metal gray, sexy -- with a comfort-grip [UNK] (much like my coveted Pilot G2 [UNK]s) AND a mouse! Even better, the Intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities: Adobe Elements 4.0, Corel Painter Essentials 3, and nik Color Efex 2.0 lE. Heaven just got better! The Intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution, over twice that of the [UNK] Graphire product line, and, with its USB 2 connection, there's more than enough communication bandwidth, meaning better [UNK] to application response. One hesitation I have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system; will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else. The Intuos3 driver has been rock-solid in the two weeks that the [UNK] has been living with me. I've used all of my \"usual\" programs and have had no problems at all. The [UNK] has also been peacefully co-existing with two external drives, a wireless desktop receiver, a card reader, a scanner, and a printer, all riding the same USB bus. The Intuos3 has 8 \"chordable\" buttons, 4 at each side of the [UNK], to which keys, macros, or other actions may be assigned. The default for each group are the usual ALT, CTRL/Command, and Shift, along with \"space\". The placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the [UNK], holding one or more of the buttons, while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your [UNK] hand. Being chordable, you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like ALT-CTRL-S or To the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be inde[UNK]dently programmed as well. The default setting is to scroll or de[UNK]ding on the context. The ends of the strip, in keystroke mode, can be set to playback macros. The [UNK], with its 1024-level pressure-sensitive [UNK] AND \"eraser,\" also has a DuoSwitch. The DuoSwitch's two positions may also be programmed. The [UNK] action is smooth with the default nylon nib -- there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback. With the ergonomic grip, the [UNK] is extremely comfortable to hold. The 5-button mouse, designed to be used by either \"righties\" or \"lefties,\" is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility, this is more than acceptable. As with every other clickable/pressable feature associated with the Intuos3, the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options, although I've yet to find the \"fix photo,\" \"illustrate article,\" or even the \"design website\" settings. I can see only two very minor changes that I would make to this fantastic product. I would love to see the ability to add weight to the [UNK]. It is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the [UNK] is already, this feature would be the feather on the cap to me. The other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the Graphire (and was on the ArtZ II). Sometimes, having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time. For the casual home user, I would recommend the Graphire product line -- this Intuos3 model's SRP of $369 may be a bit high where a $99 entry point on the Graphire is more affordable. For the pro-consumer or professional, however, whether doing photo editing (my primary use) or illustration, the Intuos3 line is well worth the investment. It's great to be in Heaven again ...\n",

This [UNK], probably like any other model, needs a little training to get it right over the paper, but once done, it really works and faster than typing! I dont use the [UNK] or options with your [UNK] but they are no doubt very handy. I just scan in from papers, and beam it to my laptop. Both Infrared and the cable work. The cable is especially great for using the [UNK] 'live'on the screen: the scanned text appears on the pc as you type! The dictionary also comes in very handy. It must be a very complex product, but just like the Ipod or ZenXtra mp3 players: they work! So buy one and save some time!

Photos don't always print well... the only photo paper I have found to work well with my [UNK] was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when I bought it. No other photo paper has done well at all, so I suggest theirs. This is the best [UNK] we have had in 10 years, and belive me I've thrown my share out the window! I can offer THIS advice to owners of ANY [UNK]s. Always use the power switch ON THE [UNK] to turn it on off, never use the power strip switch, or the switch from properties. For some reason doing so supposedly wastes [UNK]? I don't get it, but I've always followed that advice and this [UNK] has been an absolute gem for us. Good Luck! Jeanni\n",

Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist [UNK] and did not have an attached [UNK] to carry a water bottle. The [UNK] [UNK] addressed both of these deficiencies. When worn as a waist [UNK], it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the [UNK] firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the [UNK]. There are two water [UNK]es on the [UNK] [UNK] (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona). The Adorama [UNK] [UNK] is a great travel [UNK]. It is light weight and has great utility.

When I first copied all the files to the [UNK] it took a couple of minutes, but now I just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that I don't even notice them (just a second or two). I also seemlessly work on the files on both a PC at work and a Mac at home. To me the best feature is the reliability. Between my husband and I, we've had several Cruzer Minis in various sizes and each one has worked great, even through accidental abuse. One of his 512 [UNK] [UNK]s accidently went through the washing machine. We thought the data was gone, but when it dried out, it worked fine. Just today I found my 2 GB [UNK] at the bottom of the [UNK]; it had been left in a pocket and had gone through both the washing machine and [UNK]. Yep, it still worked! I'm buying a new one to replace it (just in case) because I don't know it there might be some long-term effects from the water and heat, but I'll keep using this one for less important applications. Changes are good, though, that it'll never have a problem. These things are amazingly reliable\n",

      "After doing a fair amount of Internet research about [UNK] players and their features I was under the impression that I would go with an iPod. Having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years I have never been fond of the [UNK] and have always been a little biased towards PC's. This added to my reticence to own a [UNK] product and the growing complaints about service on the iPod being a 'bit' over priced I forged on. I started reading through all of the reviews I could find on the Internet and as always, found a wealth of them here on Amazon. To my dismay all the reviews I could find on product names I knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely. Thats is, until I got to the iAudio line. The reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things I could easily overlook. I love the control, I am big guy with big hands and I have rarely, if ever, pushed the control and not had the result I was intending. I have had my iAudio X5 for over a month and I have nothing bad to say in the least. I am an avid Linux user and it works flawlessly with Linux, the sound quality is phenomenal, except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those. The FM tuner is great (you wont get that on an iPod). I travel a lot and I pipe my X5 through my car [UNK] using a cassette tape converter plugged into the [UNK] out port. What else can I say, this is a great product with great features and it looks good too!

      "I have had my [UNK] [UNK] Deluxe for 5...yes, FIVE years (actually longer). While I take decent care of it, it has taken care of me. My doctor has one too...exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced, but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to. I finally ordered a new PDA with all the capabilities of my [UNK] and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it. (I'm not selling it...good karma) Down to business - the [UNK] [UNK] Deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore. But in its day it was. Great product and if you don't need the bells and whistles (or color display)...go for this. Totally flawless. People often complain about the styli of other PDAs. No complaints here. Not only is it relatively comfortable, it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends (doesn't break) and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device. I literally lost my ORIGINAL [UNK] just a few days ago. The display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now, but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun (heck, a good deal of the new ones don't have IR)... go for it. And for the price I just saw it listed for on Amazon ($85) it's a total steal. Great product\n",

I never leave home without it its small, easy and comfortable to hold, and it wont die if you drop it. Wiht my previous [UNK] I had an issue with it erasing all the songs and i know other people who have had that issue with other [UNK]s but this one hasn't let me down yet.

But to my surprise the [UNK] is still running and there have been no problems. We have digital [UNK] and the pictures are great. It took me a couple of weeks to get use to watching [UNK] with such sharp color and contrast. However, if you are watching normal digital programming you may not be too happy as it is flat.

Anyway, the [UNK]s arrived, we installed them (they look great and inconspicuous in our living room ceiling) and I'm quite impressed. Note that we're using these for \"whole-house\" background music, not home theater, so my standards aren't as high as they would be in the HT case. But for a 6.5\" [UNK], these put out a surprising amount of [UNK], and clear highs. Right now we just have a cheap amplifier hooked up while we're shopping for a better one, and they still sound great. These probably would be just fine for HT rear-[UNK] use (I wouldn't want any in-ceiling [UNK] for front or center HT use). Our home theater downstairs already has [UNK] [UNK]s (studio series for the fronts and center, northridge for the rears) and I've been very happy with them.

Pros: Price is good for a ip [UNK] with tilt/pan. viewnetcam.com feature is a great addition to the [UNK] package. Works great with similar model panasonic [UNK]s.

The [UNK] is great...lots of shortcut buttons right on the [UNK], making navigation VERY easy. A couple of features on the [UNK] I really like are the scroll whell on the left, the favorites buttons (all customizable, as are all the shortcut buttons on this [UNK]) and the very comfortable hand rest. I got this refurbished and it works like new! I HIGHLY suggest this. The only drawback is that it is a little bigger than I would have liked, but I don't mind it nearly as much as my girlfriend.

Here are three things I really liked about this product: 1) The AM/FM [UNK] is outstanding. I am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear. Listening to FM on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure. 2) The buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function. This is something Sangean seems to get very well. 3) The multi-level display lighting can be turned OFF, or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright. A few things I didn't like. The pilot light for \"ON\" is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night. I had to put black electrical tape over it. The AUX input is a mini-jack instead of RCA connector. Minor inconvenience here. And finally, the cabinet is nice wood, but the finish is not as good as I think it could be. This [UNK] is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than I expected for this price. It's a keeper\n",

The only complaint I have with this unit is there is no way to connect a turn table (yes, I'm old). So I kept the [UNK] for dedicated service to the record player. I have my son hook everything up as he is taking networking in school. For him it's a breeze. I don't even look at the directions. I just say \"here\". Having said that; I think this thing is great! If you are my age and can go back 30 years to your first sound system, you paid a lot more to get a simple 200 watt system (WOW) for your records and cassettes. Ahh.... technology. I love this thing! I can understand that some folks want something better, but for 95% of us, this will be the last one you will ever need. Highly recommended. 4 stars for the lack of LP connection. Otherwise.... 5 all the way\n",

Plus, at $99.99, its much less than other retailers. btw, i ordered it at $104.99, then contacted [UNK] about the price drop.

I called about the noisy power supply and they are sending me the improved replacement. I use 2100 mah Nimh batteries which I charge externally. I have two sets. The [UNK] works well with these. I found that the internal [UNK] by itself, indoors, is not enough. I used the included wire [UNK] with moderately good results. But more convient is using the telescoping [UNK]. This [UNK] works, according to the manual, for [UNK] and SW only, but I found that extending it fully, is effective in all cases. Ressults using this method were similar to the wire. Holding the [UNK] and using the headset may also improve [UNK]. Hams know that the [UNK] is a critical part of any receiver. There are limits to what is possible in a package this size.

For movies, it does a wonderful job of augmenting the atmosphere of scenes without being too boomy. It really enhances music by bringing out lower notes and sounds that are not normally perceived with the use of most other subwoofers on the market. I am not certain it can go as low as 27Hz since I have not measured, but I am not concerned with trying to disturb the neighbors or shake the walls. I just wanted to obtain the most precies and best sounding system I could. I was able to do so with the addition of this sub. I am glad I found and tried it before paying much more for another sub I was considering. Yet I hate the fact that it is advertised as being a 250-watt sub. Its Peak Dynamic Power is 250 watts.

      "I have to say this [UNK] [UNK] has far exceeded anything I hoped for. When I first opened the box it was shipped in I was very put off. There was a Very, Very strong chemical smell. I chalked it up to something in the packaging material. It turns out that was not where the smell was coming from. It was the [UNK] [UNK] itself. Having worked in a shoe factory years ago I was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue. The smell hung around for a couple of days. Now, 1 week after having received my purchase if I put my nose close to the [UNK], it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue. I would caution those with allergies and/or asthma to consider this prior to purchase. As an asthmatic I can say it did affect my breathing some what. That seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened. I have finished with my public health warning. On to the [UNK] [UNK]. It is simply the best [UNK] [UNK] I have ever used. I have had wrist problems for over 4 years now. I have had [UNK] and pain from my right pinkie finger to my elbow as a result of console gaming and lots of keyboarding work. In the past week my [UNK] has greatly reduced. My pain is almost gone. My wrist sits perfectly on the wrist rest. The [UNK] actually cradles my wrist. The wrist rest moves with my hand, so well and with so much support, it seems to be an extension of my body. A new improved appendage. I have found myself resting my wrist on the [UNK] even while not computing but just sitting at my desk. It truly is that comfortable. I already have plans to purchase two more for friends as Christmas gifts. Worth Every Cent! Go For It! You Will Not Be Disappointed!\n",

      "I'm a college kid, recreational audiophile and bass fanatic, studying engineering. I started off building a custom sub encloser with dual Kicker CompVR 12\" subs driven by a 1200W Sony amp. I haven't stopped searching for great sound since. I'm running a pair of these off an H/K AVR240, combined with a JBL EC35 center, a JBL S120PII 400w sub, and two sets of E30 surrounds. I'm big on trying anything before I buy it. I was able to listen to these and the [UNK] (the dual 6\" floorstandings) at a local audio store before they were discontinued. I loved the sound of these and the Polk and Klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics. With the JBLs at a fraction of the price here on Amazon, it was no question. The only issue was what model to get... I heard very little difference in qualtiy between the [UNK] and [UNK]. The dual 6\" put out a bit lower frequencies, but the difference was so small that I wouldn't be able to notice without the speakers side by side. Living in a small college apartment the [UNK] and [UNK] were beautiful, but a bit overkill for what I needed. I deceided on these over the [UNK] with the hopes that a single 8\" would draw less from my amp than the dual 6\" for a bit less money. Beautiful home theater and music speaker... crisp highs, defined mids, and respectable bass. They are a bit top heavy, as any tower will be. and I love extremely low, loud bass, and as such, I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub. Movies sound great: Saving Private Ryan, Fifth Element, 40 year old virgin, Anchorman, etc... etc... Music is also fantastic (with different amp settings tuned for genre): Ambient, electronica, hip-hop, rap, jazz, 80s, classical, rock. Ulrich Schnauss, Bonobo, DJ Shadow, Busta, Snoop, E40, Louis Armstrong, Michael Jackson, Bach, Korn, Metallica, Hoobastank, 311. If you're looking for a quality tower speaker... this is it. Bass fanatics, look at the S120PII. you won't regret it. ~shakas~\n",

      "I have owned this [UNK] for almost two years and have put thousands of miles on it in NYC (my home town) and traveling on business across the US.

First this thing has 3 major [UNK]s and a 4th 'open' [UNK]; A padded laptop [UNK] large enough for a Mac 17\" with enough room left over of books or magazines. The second [UNK] has an internal file folder compression panel, that keeps your paperwork flat, orderly and compressed against your body(If you ever had the paper clip come off of a 40 page document in your [UNK] you know how great this feature is). The final main [UNK] contains an integrated open-top mesh [UNK] for your power brick and other miscellaneous computer gear. Again this has been designed to keep the weight compressed and close to your body. Each [UNK] has plenty of extra room beyond its required purpose. The forth 'open' [UNK] is stiff outer panel with a compression draw strings around the sides in which you can stuff: your book, newspaper, umbrella, rain jacket, lunch, magazine, camera, iPod or anything you need to securely stash away and retrieve at a moments notice while on the go. A great feature! Finally this rig is fitted out with no less than 5 additional zippered pockets and 4 pockets-inside-of-pockets AND: a separate gear [UNK], as well as a CD-ROM sleeve and a removable cell phone pocket on the shoulder strap. The styling is professional enough of serious meetings. You can also carry the [UNK] to the side with its well padded handle. This is key in elevators and subways. All and all you can load this down for a 3 day road trip and it still feels solid and balanced on your back. Final notes: - Zippers are high quality with big rubber grips - The black & grey color scheme will not show dirt and wear. - Fits snug under airline seats - Good padding on shoulders and back panel. - Did I mention all the pockets? Any down side? Having this [UNK] becomes an exercise in self control for pack-rats. When full this [UNK] is BIG.

      "This Eton [UNK] is the U.S. domestic version of the Chinese Tecsun PL-550 all-band pocket sized [UNK]. The Chinese version is legended in the native language and utilitarian in appearance and less expensive. The Eton is, well, in English with slight curves. I have used and tested other Tecsun produced [UNK]s, including the PL-200 (Eton 10) and the Grundig eTraveller VII. This [UNK], like the other Tecsun models, has excellent frequency discrimination, as well as the ability to directly enter the frequency desired (if you know it), or scan through the AM, [UNK] and many shortwave bands, find the stations you like and store their frequencies. Closely allied, for example, [UNK] stations within 200 kHz (only the strongest will be heard on most commercial [UNK] receivers) of each other, can be picked up with clarity, positioning the manuverable whip antenna. Very, very few [UNK]s, excepting expensive car [UNK]s, can boast such performance in the Unites States. Now on the market are other comparable [UNK]s, all made by Tecsun in China using the very same sophisicated reception circuitry regelated previously to expensive shortwave receivers. This model has other features as well: two preset wake-up times for programs from preselected stations, scanning of all bands for stations and an antenna trimmer which permits optimizing reception on weakly received broadcasts, some 500 station memories and special reception selectivity for shortwave stations whose frequencies are almost overlapping. For the price, this [UNK] is simply an excellent value, but people wishing to receive shortwave broadcasts are warned: shortwave reception from this [UNK], and every other shortwave [UNK] for that matter, of stations other than the powerful broadcasters, benefits enormously from the use of an external long wire antenna. Tecsun does provide a retractable wire antenna with the [UNK]. Alas, as with almost all [UNK]s this size, there is no single side band (SSB) reception, an enhancement that, defying digital technology, actually requires listener intervention to optimize and has great potential, but has, for the present at least, been consigned to the province of the technical listener more interested in ascertaining distant reception than actual broadcast information. The Dalai Lama for all his 5,000 watts SSB from Tibet can not be heard on this [UNK]. China [UNK] shortwave, at 150,000 watts conventiona AM shortwave, with Canadian relay stations, does just fine. Australian [UNK], at the same power, [UNK] Havana, [UNK] Serbia, Croatia, Russia, Netherlands, Sweden, India, Israel, etc., at lesser power, and some with and most without relay stations, are also heard clearly on the Eastern seaboard during their times of broadcast - usually in the early evening EST\n",

      "I've had my E-10 for around nine months and have been most impressed by it's [UNK]. My interests in [UNK] pretty much revolve around A.M.(or medium wave) DX'ing and shortwave listening. It's [UNK] on A.M. is on a par with the highly regarded [UNK] KA-1103 which I received for Christmas this year. Shortwave [UNK] is very close, however, the [UNK] is superior in this area (and features SSB tuning as well)F.M.? The E-10 is well above average but falls short of the [UNK] KA-1103. I've yet to see a [UNK] that can equal the [UNK]s [UNK] in this area, but the E-10 is closer than most.Build quality,ergonomics,and appearance are second to NONE and better than MOST. The slightly rubberized texture of this set just plain feels good when handling and adds to the to the overall impression that this is a \"Top of the line\" portable multi band receiver even though it's moderately priced.It's LCD digital display is one of the largest and nicest I've seen,very easy to see and well lit with a pleasant orange backlight. Other amenities such as 500 plus memories,12/24 hour clock,I.F. shift and antennae trim which are both useful in Shortwave reception,local/dx switch and the internal battery charger for NICAD or NIMH batteries all add up to make this a [UNK] I'm glad I purchased and often recommend to those needing a [UNK] of this type.Even the accessories included with this [UNK] such as the carrying satchel,earbuds,and reel-up shortwave antennae are top notch! Now, if you're wondering why, after all this praise I only gave it a four star rating,and not a five it's because Eton did not provide SSB tuning capability on this receiver. And it's a shame because it's shortwave [UNK] is good enough to utilize it. In my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional [UNK]. Hence they only \"hit a triple\"(which is way more exciting nonetheless, I'm a baseball nut too) and not a home run\n",

The picture is amazing in both color and clarity. The BAD: We reset the sound coming directly from its speakers, but because of speaker location underneath/below the screen,it lacks sparkle, esp at low to med. volume. The UGLY: Imagine sending your intelligent,pretty young daughter out on her first date, with shoveled-on make-up, and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress. The \"Piano Black\" case on this [UNK] is a nightmare! It shows a rippled effect, which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines (even lightly) on it.

Setup took about 15 minutes with absolutely no hitches and no issues - the first time that has happened for me with a LogiTech prouct.

Anyway the [UNK] is certainly up to the standard of the [UNK] itself. It comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself.

It fits snugly in this [UNK], yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update. The [UNK] has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in [UNK] of falls. I have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all. The belt clip is sturdy and secure. The magnetic snap for closing it works great. The [UNK] can be closed with headphones attached, but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access.

      "This was my first [UNK] system of any kind. I wasn't sure what to expect. I have a small Mazda Miata so I wanted a small-screen [UNK] that did not overwhelm my small [UNK] and this did not disappoint. I was afraid that the screen would be too small, but it's perfect. I don't think a bigger screen would do anything more than take up more space. I live in New York City and before putting it in my car I walked with the [UNK] unit in my hands. Perhaps because of the tall buildings and the slow walking speed it took more than 30 minutes for it to initially receive a satellite signal. I was convinced it was defective. It's not. Once I put it on the dash of my car and began driving it acquired a satellite signal within a few minutes. This unit comes with a 128Mb Micro SDcard onto which you can load a few state maps at one time. I ordered a 1Gb Micro SDcard along with this [UNK] (for approx. $11 on Amazon) and loaded ALL of North America at one time. This eliminates the need to re-load maps when traveling anywhere in the country. It's worth the extra effort. This unit can be quickly moved from one car to another, especially a rental car anywhere in North America. My very first test of this thing was on the very complicated underpasses and overpasses in northern Manhattan and the Bronx. It was flawless! It's impossible to get lost with this thing. Occasionally I've made a turn too early or too late and within seconds it will re-calculate the best route. The combination of the voice prompts, the highlighted route you need to go, and the current and next street(s) at the top are excellent. Also, the estimated arrival time in the lower left is nice, but does not account for traffic jams. The arrival time will just keep getting pushed back the slower you travel. It's kind of a \"best traffic scenario\" prediction. This is so easy to use I'm thinking of buying one for my 68-year-old mother who doesn't have a clue when it comes to technology, but I'm convinced she could use this without a problem (once I've loaded the maps for her.) If not having bluetooth and all the other latest bells and whistles on a [UNK] system doesn't bother you (as it doesn't bother me) buy this, you won't be sorry!\n",

      "I bought this device to mount on the wall in front of my work desk, and for that purpose it's an admirable [UNK]. Plus: The contrast- adjustable [UNK] displays current date and time without you having to set it, the buttons for call list browsing, option setting, etc. are on the back of the receiver so you don't have to take the [UNK] off the hook to use them. The sound quality is great of course, this being a corded [UNK], and it feels somewhat worthy in your hand. The keypad lights up, although only for a few seconds - dial fast in the dark! The ring tone is nice at its medium setting. Minus: I find the base a bit bulky, the [UNK] has no background light, and when the [UNK] is set to \"hi\" volume, you do hear a bit of a screeching noise when putting the set down on the base (I keep the setting at \"lo\" though, which is plenty loud). My main gripe is that the [UNK] doesn't have a [UNK] indicator, which would be extremely sweet with my [UNK] company (Vonage). Also, the [UNK] id stuff works with batteries ONLY - at least, they could have put a 6v ac adapter plug on the [UNK]. Still, four stars because the [UNK] does all it says it does\n",

      "I checked previous reviews before purchasing this [UNK] case. What I received is what I expected. Lots of compartments to store needed accessories, sturdy construction, pleasant appearance. As with a previous review, my only citicism is the [UNK] strap. While it is comfortable when used, it is also fixed and cannot be removed. I've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane. Other than that, it was a good purchase for the price\n",

      "In spite of some of the poor reviews for this product, it met all of my expectations 100%. Thanks to the reviews, I understood that the unit doesn't have a builtin antenna or batteries, which was helpful to know in advance. But of course the specifications never claimed those features in the first place. I was looking for a small [UNK] to fit in the corner of my bathroom, and this unit is perfect for that. As a bonus, I can not only watch the news while I'm getting ready for work in the morning, but I can listen to MP3 rips when I'm in the shower. I've owned the unit for several weeks now, use it every day, and have never had a problem playing any [UNK], either copy-protected movies or CDs. My only concern so far has been that I didn't receive a warrantee card with the unit. I especially like the portability. It's so easy to pick up and take anywhere, such as watching a movie in bed, and even outside (if it's not too bright out) for watching sports on the patio. The speakers are adequate, considering their size, and the headphone jack lets me either use headphones or external amplified speakers if I want better quality. In summary, I have to repeat that my expectations were set before I bought the unit and I am very pleased with what I got for the price\n",

The really powerful potential for these [UNK]s is yet to be realised but I'm thinking about them! Let me know how you are using yours. In addition to my data files, I downloaded applications giving my [UNK] drive the power to accomplish tasks on its own.

Although 1GB [UNK]s worked adequately with the \"Elph\" we noticed, early on, that its 10.0 mega pixels quickly filled up the photo [UNK]. The 2.0GB holds many more photos (over 400 shots and counting) than the 1GB. At half the price of other brands, the PNY is proving to be very satisfactory (we purchased two 2.0s at once).

I made some adjustments which did make it sound a little better but nowhere near the [UNK]. I went to a big box store and they told me it was because these companies expect that you will hook it up through a [UNK] system and not use the [UNK] sound. {shrug} I do for movies but not for regular [UNK].

Most importantly, our little boy just loves playing this [UNK]. Hopefully it will inspire him to continue and so it is as great an introdroduction to music as any other [UNK], including the electronic [UNK]s, we have purchased for him.

      "In my opinion, [UNK]'s strength lies in its TVs. This line of [UNK] sets are expensive, but you'll definitely get what you pay for. The picture quality is incredible! The beauty of this set is also material - it is a work of art. While the internal speakers are decent, I would have been just as happy not to have them. But thanks to the beautiful design of the bezel, you don't even know the speakers are there. Some reviewers have mentioned \"[UNK] clouding\", and for a product of this price it would serve you well to do the appropriate Google search. But [UNK] stands by its products, and if you receive a set that is not up to standards, they will rectify the situation. Also, many reviewers are mentioning a lower-quality picture. It is important to understand what kind of signal you are feeding the TV, and what signal will give you the optimal image. Not all HD signals are the same, and will provide you with varying degrees of quality. Be prepared to upgrade other equipment to explore the maximum potential of this device. But, I have yet to see a signal that wasn't enhanced by being viewed on this set over my previous Panasonic tube set. The interchangable bezels is a nice idea, but only for those with deep(er) pockets. The silver set alone is beautiful, and if I had only one complaint, it would be that it's harder to get matching [UNK] peripherals in silver than you might think. All in all, it's the best [UNK] you can buy\n",

      "Great [UNK] unit that does what is supposed to do and flawlessly at that. Clear easy to read display and instructions. Menus and interface are self-intuitive to the degree that you just turn it on and start using it. No downloads, activations or learning required. Satellite acquisition takes just a few seconds and recalculation when you miss a turn or instruction is equally fast. Accuracy is impressive with spot-on instructions and updated maps. Even small streets in rural areas are recognized and labeled. After looking at the [UNK] and Magellan units I thought this was the best unit for the price. It has the largest screen and the most features for this price range. A previous reviewer complained about the misrepresentation of [UNK] capabilities to which I completely disagree. The fact the [UNK] features are available at this price range is already impressive. Also unless you buy a much pricier unit none of them come with a [UNK] stand. All manufacturers seem to sell them as options ([UNK] included).\n",

As mentioned in another review, I love that if you have to stop playing whatever your listening to it will pick up on the same track when you press play again, it also fits in my back pocket so I can walk around the house listening to anything while doing chores, the earpieces fit well, there is absolutley nothing wrong with this walkman!

      "This univeral [UNK] player comes packed very neatly in an Oppo cloth case and is very sleek. The finish of the [UNK] player is excellent, however the remote is not up to snuff in this department. This player can play PAL [UNK]s, it upconverts it to NTSC & 1080i. It's loaded with features that you probably won't see on most [UNK] players out there. The upconversion works well though I'm not sure the color handling is the best. The audio controls in the setup are awesome. People have complained about the [UNK] tray being flimsy/cheap, but I think it's just fine. It's very quick to load and play. You may want to keep the remote safely because if you lose or damage it you won't be able to control most of the features. The [UNK] cable that is included with the player is of good quality. Probably worth around fifty bucks in the market. Price to performance/features you can't beat this universal [UNK] player. Buy one and you'll know\n",

It found my TV automatically, because it's set for a Sony TV by default. When I had to locate a [UNK] for my [UNK] player, I got worried-- none of the 3 [UNK] [UNK] [UNK]s listed in the manual worked during the setup process. But there's a search function to use in that situation, which allows you to scroll through all the [UNK]s in the chip's library till one works. It found one within seconds, and I was up and running.

True you will only get about 720P resolution from the broadcast over the air currently, but when the Blue-ray [UNK] movies are out in larger number and at a more reasonable price, this will become the standard. And this [UNK] has 2 [UNK] ports so you are ready to go. I have had another CRT sharp which I have liked, and this product is no different. Picture is amazing. Some analog channels dont look that great, but I am at the point where where I would rather watch whatever is on an [UNK] channel. Note: I am in what is considered an upgraded cable section. The [UNK] has the tuner to receive [UNK] without the box as I have said, but I can't speak to sections that are not \"upgraded\", so you may want to look into that.

The firmware was one rev prior so I updated it - absolutely smooth as silk. Reformatted the drives. I chose the [UNK] 1 option and [UNK] format. I like the fact that you can specify [UNK] size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume. The drive is fairly solid. The fan is not very noisy. The front slide up access door is a little kludgy. Good user interface. I was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen [UNK] and [UNK].

One button click now setups all those devices to the right status for a particular entertainment activity.

All is not rosy though. Added the [UNK] [UNK] to the entertainment arena. The Bluetooth requirements of the [UNK] leaves it out of the IR RF remotes inner circle. Consider this if you need a combined solution for Infra Red RF as well as Bluetooth devices. ( The [UNK] [UNK] is deliberately left powered on so it is not an issue in this case).

Among these were an Avaya 4610SW SIP ([UNK]) phone and a PC serving as an Asterisk server (Asterisk is an open source PBX). This configuration has worked well for a couple of years now. In the past few months I've been having occasional disconnects of [UNK] calls coming in to Asterisk from the PSTN. After some investigation, I decided to move my phone and server off WiFi and onto a HomePlug [UNK], using the electrical wiring as another [UNK]. The hardest part of the installation was freeing up an electrical outlet in my second-floor office where my phone is, in the basement where the server is, and in the family room on the first floor where the LinkSys WiFi [UNK]/access point is located. After that, it was just a matter of plugging in an [UNK] cable from the Netgear box to the [UNK], and moving the [UNK] cables from the WiFi boxes for the phone and server to the Netgear boxes.

      "This is an AWESOME little device. Let me start with the pros: 1) EASY: Incredibly easy setup (literally press one button - never believed it, but it's true. Plug in the usb transmitter, press the blue button & voila.) 2) GOOD SOUND: For a small set of [UNK]s, these things sound great. They are not going to compare to [UNK]s hooked up to your rack stereo system, but sound very good and comparable to a $45 two-[UNK] set of monitor-side [UNK]s. There's a built in sub-woofer that helps as well. 3) WIRELESS RANGE: With 4 AA batteries, you can carry this little guy around your whole house - and outside your house. Reception is great. I am used to bluetooth headsets that don't really work much further than 10 feet from the phone - I had doubts about bluetooth [UNK]s, but I am amazed with reception these guys have. 4) CONTROLS: the Forward, Reverse & Pause buttons on the [UNK] work fine with both Media Player or Yahoo Music Engine running on the laptop(the only two I tried). Again, I was surprised, but they worked flawlessly. 5) COOL: As far as cool factor, this little guy is definitely that. Cons: 1) NO REMOTE: It would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound, FF, RW, Pause, Play controls. 2) NO CONTROL FROM PC: You can't control the sound (or mute) from the laptop - only from the [UNK]s. 3) SOUND: Above I said the sound was good - and it is considering the size of this system. However, these are small [UNK]s and a mini-sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too. It's good, but it's not going to compare to a quality set of [UNK]s hooked up to your rack stereo system. There is base but not a great deal - you definitely won't feel the music with these [UNK]s. 4) VOLUME: Volume is limited - it's enough to fill a mid-sized room, but not much more. For $100, this is an outstanding little [UNK] system that does an amazing job with NO WIRES. Carry it to your kid's room. To the garage. To the basement. No wires, nothing. If convenience is and portability is important to you, and if medium sound quality is ok, then I would HIGHLY recommend this [UNK] system. It's great. Personally, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them because I would really like fuller sound (this was an attempt at easy [UNK]s for my living room) and more base - but they're so cool and convenient, that I doubt I'll be able to give them up!

The only thing I don't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the [UNK] cups, but maybe it help keep your [UNK]s cool, maybe. I really give them 4 1/2 stars. I paid about $90 for them and I have no regrets. So if you want a [UNK] set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the Sony mdr-300/mdr-400 they don't have [UNK] but good [UNK]phones. Hope this helped, good luck\n",

      "This [UNK] provides good protection to the [UNK] via a skin that the [UNK] slides into and a rigid clear [UNK] that fits over the screen (stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the [UNK]). It works well for jogging and working out. The [UNK] (better than leather for sweaty workouts) [UNK] fits well on my upper arm (6' 200lb) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms. It is a bit awkward to silde the [UNK] into the skin while keeping the screen [UNK] in place. I first began sliding the [UNK] into the [UNK] mount but found that difficult to keep the screen [UNK] in place so I now just clip it in which seems to work fine. It has tried to come loose from the [UNK] a couple of times but I think this was due to not ensuring the [UNK] was fully seated into the [UNK]. I have only used the [UNK] for about 3 weeks now and I am satisfied at this point, I am only giving 4 stars due to the screen [UNK] being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included. Also on another note, apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the [UNK] because almost all [UNK]s I have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception. The button is next to the upper left edge and any decent [UNK] has to almost cover this area to work properly. All in all you will be satisfied with the [UNK] and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the [UNK] and a good [UNK] also so it's a solid value.\n",

I use this [UNK] when I'm studying in the library, on the computer at a coffee shop or even at home using my laptop at the desk. It provides a nice little jet of air right at my face which makes me feel cooler all over. I can even direct it right in front of me and only the nose of the [UNK] head is visible because when the [UNK] is running, of course, you can see right through the blades. The [UNK] runs quietly too. I've had a couple of times when the [UNK] is making a bit of a [UNK] or isn't running a quickly as normal. I just pop off the [UNK] head, adjust the blades a bit (they are flexible vinyl and I give them a little twist and a crease to make them more rigid as they sometimes get bent in my carrying case), pop the [UNK] head back on and it's good as new again. While I like this product a lot, I doubt with frequent use that it will last much more than a year but I still think it's well worth it. My only regret is that I didn't order two or three of these for future back-ups if needed. The light works well too. It does not illuminate the entire keyboard but in a dark setting it does provide enough illumination for the typical user (a hunt and peck typist may be frustrated but I think it may be enough light for that kind of visibility as well) and definitely enough light to read from a book or hard copy document.\n",

I'm a bit of an audiophile (on a reasonable budget), with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10\" [UNK] in my truck. I'm most satisfied with the [UNK] subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess. I listen to a lot of music with double-[UNK] drumming and thought that this [UNK] would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10\" sub I like so much. Not the case. What I get is very quick [UNK] with that ground-shaking impact that I always look for. I'm still going easy on 'er for the break-in period, but I can say that the trailer for Kingdom of Heaven (included on the Blu-Ray disc) sounds absolutely stunning.

      "Below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks. Pros: ----- 1. Amazing sound especially when watching DVD movies 2. Very good progessive scan DVD picture quality 3. Simple, compact and all-in-one design 4. Remote control can work with various [UNK]'s, Cable boxes and VCR's 5. Can play both NTSC and PAL DVD's Cons: ----- 1. Expensive 2. No [UNK] output 3. Non-intuative remote control 4. No headphone jack Overall, I love and chose the [UNK] 321 because of the sound quality and compact design. I got this system because I wanted a compact all-in-one media center and I was not interested in getting a HTIB with 5 speakers. I looked at Denon (2 products), [UNK] and Samsung. I use this on my 23\" Samsung LCD [UNK] using Monster component video cables and while I would have preferred to take advatange of its [UNK] capabilties, the reality is that I am very happy with this image quality. Movies such as Lord of the Rings, The Matrix and Hero look and sound fantastic. Prior to this I was looking at the [UNK] DAV-X1 which is much cheaper and more feature-rich. However the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me. For example, my PAL DVDs cannot be played on the [UNK] whereas on the [UNK] it was no problem. I am of the opinion that [UNK] is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products. To be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their TrueSpace 2.1 surround sound feature. My couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me. According to [UNK] the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the [UNK]. Sometimes TrueSpace works and sometimes I can't hear it. I believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other. If surround sound is really that important to you, then you should get a 5.1 system. This product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3D sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec-room. The audio quality from music CD's is very good and while I wish this had an iPod port as found on the Denon, I am very content using the Aux port\n",

      "Every house should have a Grundig [UNK] Deluxe. Big, brawny, \"grabbing\" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this [UNK] means serious business, the Grundig [UNK] Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig [UNK], eliminating some of the \"drift\" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset [UNK]s often sound like tin, the Grundig [UNK] DL has depth. Is it a perfect [UNK]? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Super[UNK] boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM. If you're looking for a [UNK] with similar features as the Grundig [UNK] DL but erases its weakness--no presets and AM overload, then you might want to check out the Grundig G4000A. It's the same price as the [UNK] and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave [UNK]. Or you might look at the stunning Kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the Eton E5. But even if you get a fancy preset [UNK], every house should have the big easy-to-use Grundig [UNK] Deluxe. Update: Comparing the [UNK] to the same-priced G4000 for several months, it becomes clear that the G4000 is a better buy: superior AM, superior separation of AM stations, presets, same warm speaker, and smaller.\n",

      "I live in an apartment building and play ( well, practice is a better word ) the bass guitar and needed headphones so I wouldn't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs TV about 6 feet from where I sit and play. The 10 foot long [UNK] was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing, so I wouldn't have to use an extention cable ( and usualy end up with feedback/distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable) The volume control on each [UNK] lets me adjust the volume so I don't have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings I like to use when not using headphones. Makes it real nice too when using an instructional CD or DVD i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head. Very light weight. Some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them 'bobble heads'. Fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere. [UNK] enters headphones on the left ear side, so you don't have to deal with the classic 'Y' split [UNK]. Easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way. [UNK] fit nicly over my ears (no pinching, gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear) and does a very nice job blocking out noise ( when my wife is awake she watchs the TV, rather loudly, which is right next to me and I bairly notice it). Plenty of padding around the ear pieces. Many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear, but these headphones I honestly don't feel anything against my ears. Even after several hours of use each night. Sound quality. Bose or pioneer they are not, but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn't be shopping in the $20 and under headphones :) That being said they are very good for sound. Sounded very good on a portable CD player. Only drawbacks I can see is that a person with large/tall ears won't get thier ears covered by the [UNK]. The inside opening of the [UNK] is aprox 2 1/4 inchs tall by 1 3/4. IMO they could have been made bigger. Also, if you have a tall head ( good distance from top of head to ear ) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears. I have a head like Drew Carry ( give you an idea head size/shape I'm talking about) and if the extension to each [UNK] would have been any shorter they wouldn't have fit. I wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don't interfere, bind, pinch or anything like that with my glasses.

With a small screwdriver pushed up through the bottom can take apart the [UNK] case. on the positive side of each [UNK] there are two small pieces of plastic. you just need to push these down so the [UNK] has a better chance of connectiing. i also found new batteris at interstate [UNK] store, 1 dollar each.

      "Our Oskar Multimedia [UNK] [UNK] arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition. My husband assembled the unit with ease, until it was time to nail the card board backing on. Following the instructions he laid the unit down on it's face, of course the kick-board had already been added so it didn't lay flat. When nailing on the backing the \"J\" board (the center [UNK] holding the entire unit together) split at every point of contact. We had ordered our Oskar [UNK] [UNK] through Amazon, directly from Ritz Camera. So, naturally I called Ritz to replace the \"J\" [UNK]. I was informed I would have to return the entire unit. I immediately pictured myself trying to get all those shelves back into the box and figured that was more trouble than I wanted to go through. So, I tracked down the number for Oskar and called them directly. They were very efficient and helpful. Within minutes I had their assurance that they would ship a new \"J\" [UNK] to my home - at no additional charge. The [UNK] arrived within the promised ten-days. This unit was exactly what we ordered and works well for it's intended purpose. I would caution you to be very careful nailing on the [UNK], so as not to split the center [UNK]. My favorite feature of the Oskar Multimedia Wood [UNK] [UNK] is that they include plenty of extra shelves, unlike so many other brands. I have an entire stack of shelves that I can add as needed.

Just copy [UNK]'s & [UNK]'s on there like a removable USB drive. 5. A/V out to TV is cool. 6. A/V in to record video is a nice extra. So far it's played every [UNK] i've thrown at it. I've got 15GB of [UNK] on there and just let it random play the whole lot I use the a2 mostly when driving. I got a nice FM transmitter that powers off the cig socket, sound quality is pretty good. Only problem i have is that i have to carry the a2 in the house at night for fear of it getting stolen out of the car ! I also invested in the silicon cover from zcover-it comes with a plastic screen protector and is perfect for when my 2 yr old wants to watch one of his movies on there (the a2 makes for a great pacifier !) Mine came with the latest firmware on there so there was no need to upgrade.

The remote control is powerful enough to control the unit from accross the room and adheres to the refrigerater (magnet) with my wife useing it to hang things.

Using the [UNK] pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the [UNK] clearly stand out. And if you are wondering, no matter how bright your [UNK] is, without particles in the air you wont see the [UNK].

(One recent comparison in a headphone artcle came up with a dead heat.) This is surprising, considering that the [UNK] is one of the most reasonably priced of the major mid-priced headphones. The bass is full but nicely textured - not a touch of bass bloat to be found here. The highs are detaied and never seemed sharp to me, and the overall sound offers a huge soundstage. Instead of the music being on top of your, these [UNK] lend a perceived distance of a few feet; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant, and surprisingly makes rock music grandiose in an appealing kind of way. These headphones don't require a headphone amp, but certainly profit from one. The 30 ohm version makes for more volume, though the 250 ohm version is standard, and best for most daily listening. The [UNK] sounds great, but lacks a tad of the [UNK]'s high-end sparkle. Conversely, [UNK]'s value, comfort, and workmanship can't help but impress. This is a phone that has labored under the shadow of the AKGs and the Senn 650s, but listeners are always impressed by the [UNK]s sound. It may be your best value in a mid-priced, all-purpose headphone\n",

I've used several other brands of canal [UNK]phones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best, but most are painful with a [UNK] on. The \"bulb\" you see in the picture rests in the crook of your [UNK], so there is nothing extending past your [UNK] to get crammed in deep. Second, the sound quality is fantastic.

The band that most [UNK]s have presses down on your head, but not too much. It also folds down quite nicely, though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress. Haven't tried out the actual noise-[UNK] feature, but if the rest of the [UNK] quality is consistent, then it will work just as well.

I've had it a week now, and I love it. Standard-definition picture quality is just okay, but are any of us buying these [UNK]s to watch [UNK]? I get about 15 [UNK] channels through my cable company, including all four major networks plus ESPN, ESPN2 and a couple music and movie channels. Therefore, a majority of everything I watch is available in [UNK] anyway. [UNK] content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10-12 feet. [UNK] content looks awesome (including black levels), and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p. I can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available. I'm going to wait another year or two for the High-Definition DVD format war to play out before I buy a Blu-Ray or [UNK]-DVD player. But I've watched standard-definition DVD on my Xbox with this [UNK], and the picture is beautiful. I'm sure High-Definition DVD would look a little better in a side-by-side comparison, but you will not have any complaints watching standard-definition DVD on this [UNK]. In short, this is an excellent [UNK], especially compared to other 1080p models in its size range. If you're looking for something in the range of $2000-$2200, this is the one you want. Enjoy\n",

I like the fact that it's held off of the [UNK]'s screen so it won't scratch. The clickwheel is easily usable, actually more so because of the circle around it. I bought the [UNK] on Amazon from SonicSwap and am astounded at how fast I got it. 2 days! Amazing. This [UNK] is for the 60GB iPod with Video.

      "I agree with the comments posted here. Like most of us, I was interested in the [UNK] [UNK] yet put off by the prestige price. Even on E-Bay the going price ended up being around $400 -- for a used older model. So I did some research and stumbled upon a nice comparison-shopper article that put the [UNK] up against several competitors, including this high-end TEAC. I have to say that I'm entirely satisfied. The chrome retro look is quite appealing, and the model has a couple of features that, for me, beat out [UNK] entirely. I wanted a top-loading door like the old [UNK] models but also the ability to play [UNK] like the new ones, and this gave me both. The [UNK] and punch is remarkable. At flat setting, it is a bit [UNK]y, that's true, but you get a -5 to+ 5 range for both [UNK] and treble adjustment: I set mine at -3 and +1 respectively and am very happy with the [UNK] in my bedroom. Input and alarm functions are limited but not problematic. 10 presets can be cycled though quickly enough, and just remember to set it to a station (or load a CD) that you'd want to be woken up to before calling it a night! TEAC customer service I can't comment on, but I bought a reconditioned unit from an Amazon seller for less than $100, including shipping. A sweet deal for a sweet machine.\n",

      "I didn't want to fork over 500 for a [UNK] or Boston Acoustics, or even 350 for a Cambridge [UNK], and then I found this little gem, for about 175 + shipping. I've had it for a few days, and so far I am impressed. The SX functions are very intuitive, easy to set the time and both [UNK]s. I thought it was extremely innovative to have the button that sets the time located inside the CD player compartment, no more accidentally changing the time instead of the [UNK]! The [UNK] buttons themselves will illuminate when they are activated, which is great. The buttons themselves have a nice click when you press them, and the CD, AM/FM tuner, and AUX buttons will glow when they are active. The volume control and tuner knobs are recessed, but this keeps the player from having any unsightly bulges I suppose. The snooze/sleep button is a good size. The sleep function can be toggled for 90, 60, or 30 minutes. The range of the speakers is great when you consider the size of the SX. The speakers measure about 2.5 inches, and with the volume turned up, you can definitely feel the air being pushed out of the bottom of the unit. I like that it has adjustable bass and treble, which can vary from -5 to +5. I have the bass set to +3 and treble to +2 and it sounds great. It doesn't have the range of say a home entertainment system, but definitely rivals my Sony bookshelf system. The MP3 player on the SX could be better, but is adequate. During playback, the LCD will scroll to display the filename, title, artist, and track. It can be programmed for up to 64 tracks, but I haven't had the time or patience for this. Instead, I just numbered the MP3 tracks in the order I wanted before burning them to the CD-rom. The repeat function works well, and you can choose either to repeat one track, repeat all tracks, or repeat just one folder. However, the shuffle function is rather limited, as it has only one setting which is to randomly play an MP3 from any of the folders (resulting in less than desired combinations of music), and it stop playing music after each song from all the folders has been played once. One of the things I looked for in a clock radio is an auxilliary input mini-jack, and it also has a jack for headphones. I have my laptop on my nightstand right now, and it playing MP3s on winamp sound great plugged into the SX. There are only 2 levels of brightness for the backlit LCD. The default level cannot be changed or dimmed, and is rather bright in a dark room.. it will make everything glow. Takes a little while to get used to, but is not say brighter than a typical nightlight I guess. It is a bit hard to read at night because the numbers are so small, and the brightness of the LCD can kind of drown out the analog display, but then again I wear glasses so I suppose I have nothing to blame besides my bad eyes. When the radio or CD player is in operation, the dial becomes significantly brighter but it can be toggled to the lower/default level with the dimmer button on the remote control. One other thing about the unit was the lack of a battery backup, and you will notice this is the case with many Japanese units, including the Sony clock radios. I guess the power grid in Japan is really stable, so they don't have use for this, but still, it would be nice if there was an option for a backup 9 volt battery. On the other hand, I was informed by TEAC tech support that the unit does contain a capcitor which will retain the time and [UNK] for \"up to 3 hours\". I haven't had the time to test the maximum threshold, but I can say that I did unplug the clock for about a minute, and when I plugged it back in, sure enough the time and [UNK]s were still correct. Overall I am really impressed by this unit. The only thing that could be better is if the MP3 player shuffle had a few more options, but I guess this is ok as many I have seen MP3 clock radios without any shuffle function at all! Also, I wish the LCD backlight could be adjusted a little more. It is a bit pricey at just under 200, but I have heard many clock radios, and you would have to spend 350+++ to get anywhere near the sound quality of the TEAC SX\n",

My only gripe is that the [UNK] is not very strong. I live in a tough area for [UNK], and there's slight static on my favorite stations.

[UNK] player works great and really completes the package as it seems not to increase the size of the [UNK] at all. The picture is outstanding and isn't that what really matters in the end??!! The only little annoying thing concerns what would have been a great feature but has a big limitation - the [UNK] has an auto-on feature so that you can use it like an alarm clock but it requires that you select a [UNK] on which to tune the [UNK] once it goes on. It you are use the [UNK] as I am to get signal from your [UNK] box, you must have the [UNK] input mode set to [UNK] but you can't set the auto-on to the [UNK] input (it must be a [UNK] number). The engineers just didn't think that one through all the way. Oh well, still a great [UNK]\n",

      "I bought this [UNK] for a philips 42\" plasma [UNK]. The [UNK] weighs probably about 100LBs. I thought the price for it was OK, but i don't know how much an average [UNK] would cost and think the price i paid was pretty good compared to some other [UNK]s. The [UNK] was put on our living room wall by a \"handy man\" because i didn't have a stud finder. He was able to to put the [UNK] on the wall very easily and the assembly was pretty basic. The [UNK] sits very well secured and the frame of the [UNK] is very durable and strong which leaves me with a good sense that my investment is properly secured. The 5o [UNK] function is very nice to have and is being used so the [UNK] sits a little high, but is aimed perfectly and adds a nice presentation to the house. The room for the input cables is a little small, and causes some cables to be bend a little close to the connector than i would like to see but haven't noticed any degradation in the signal. None of the cables so far look damaged and will remain that way, so its not of a concern. I took the cables and made a 1\" \"trunk\" of cables with the power cable and all and video inputs and it seamlessly hangs down the middle to a cabinet with all the accessories. The [UNK] sits very close to the wall which was a key characteristic of the project even with the 5o [UNK]. I rate this item with 5 stars because it is very well made and very strong. It also looks nice and stays well hidden. Its features with the 5o [UNK] work great and the locking bar makes removing the [UNK] easy(I had to take it off the wall to trunk the cables). I am very very happy with it and would definitely recommend this product\n",

You can encode AVI video [UNK] at 1.5mbps.Also have WMV which you can encode at 768kbps. 6. No need to install to transfer files, it works like a USB flash drive. 7. You can change backgrounds and if you put a black background and your text is black, you can change the text color to 20 difference colors or make you own. 8. The touchscreen is smooth and flawless. WHen playing music it tells you the info of the file. example [UNK] info, Hz etc. Something that is lacking on the big boys. 9. Has tv output, also has a recorder to record conversations. 10. Can view .txt files. 11. Can view pics at very high pixels. 12. Fm tuner, you can record from the FM radio. You can set the [UNK] from low to 256kbps. 13. Has a SD slot for more storage.

      "If you're an anti-commercial [UNK] type this [UNK] will probably not win you over. If however you don't like paying a monthly charge for satellite [UNK] and you want something more than just standard AM/[UNK] you might like this [UNK]. Many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting HD signals. The quality of HD is most amazing on quiet passages in Classical music, there is no noise at all, very quiet. You do notice! The [UNK]-1 is quite sensitive. It will pull in stations that other [UNK]s won't, and I'm not even talking about the HD2 streams that the stations are starting to feature. Clear Channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with HD. Their stations sound good and most of the [UNK]'s are doing HD2, a few have some interesting formats not heard on most AM/[UNK] stations. I hope the get even more adventurous. My only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get HD to lock in on AM or [UNK]. I don't believe that to be a fault of the [UNK], it's the HD system and just like [UNK] did I'm sure it will improve (ask someone over 50 about [UNK] drift) . I give it 5 stars, it's not perfect but for the price it's very good and for a first generation product I don't think it could be better than this\n",

And a much better deal moneywise. I must say that you shouldn't get a [UNK] unless you are running a Windows version with [UNK] or higher, for any other ver. won't recognize the unit. I had a pc w/SP1 and Media Center 2002, so I thought I was in trouble. Against my initial thoughts on [UNK], I went ahead and upgraded, and haven't had any problems yet. The sound is great, videos are decent, and the software is very user friendly.

      "This is my second set of [UNK] radios. I have had the 120's for a couple years now and had to try out the new 530's. First of all I really like the new color screen and the added features. The altimeter has been upgraded over the 120's and seems to be more accurate. My old 120's sitting right next to each other would display different [UNK]s. I would not use the data to survey a site but it is more accurate than the older models. We do a quite a bit of skiing an the [UNK] displays are helpful when your on the lifts or trying to figure out how many vertical feet you have skied. Especially if your using different lifts and not going all the way to the top. The new [UNK] is also helpful. With the older models you would have to be moving for the [UNK] to work right. After calibrating the new [UNK] (turning in a circle) it will work just like a regular [UNK]. I still carry a regular one in my pack while hiking as a backup, but the [UNK] on the 530 works great and has not let me down. You can also route off the [UNK] by lining up the sites on the 530 with where you want to go. The 530 will then guide you there and keep you on track if bush whacking and can't see your next way point. As with all the Rino radios the microphone is a little on the weak side. I really think it's because of the waterproofing that they do. If you don't put it close to your mouth when speaking it's really not that bad. I did pick up a pair of throat mics and they have solved any problems at all with clear communications. Lock up problem. I have experienced this once or twice the first time I used them. I did the [UNK] update and have not had the problem since. Overall these new 530's are GREAT. I have been using them for close to 2 months every weekend and sometimes during the week. Now that I have 4 of these (2 120's and 2 530's) these things are a blast to have when we are with a group. Looking forward to the ski slopes this winter. We always seem to get separated at some point and never find each other for hours. If you do a lot of outdoor activities or any Geocaching with more than one person these are perfect!! [...]\n",

My wife and I have built our HT system in our Master bedroom (16x14x10) also have 40\" Samsung LCD 4095 (1080p) and Polk audio speakers (in ceiling) LC60i for front and middle speakers and RC60i for the [UNK] speakers. I'm awaiting for Toshiba HD-XA2 that was recently ordered to complement our system and would be replacing my current infinity [UNK] with a HSU STF-2 sub. Originally my first choice was a [UNK] VSX-1016 receiver but with lack of zone 2 and HDMI video pass-thru only. I didn't think it fit our needs. However, Onkyo TX-SR604b not only was a true bargain but it also exceeded my expectations, ease of use (very easy setup) user friendly powerful enough to drive all my polk speakers clean and crisp sound. I did'nt have any problem as far as clicking sound related to HDMI issues like few folks have mentioned on their reviews and I didn't mind running extra component cable to my TV knowing it doesn't up-convert component to HDMI. The only thing that I haven't tested it yet was the zone 2 feature.

      "I've used everything from Ableton Live to ProTools to Reason and this thing is just plug and play. Very easy interface makes for no brainer recording. I'm a [UNK] and the stock sound selections are outstanding. Most players drive themselves crazy tweaking their sound but as you know it's all about the SONG. The Sessions [UNK] is a piece of cake and makes it incredibly easy to go with your inspiration instead of getting sidetracked trying to figure out all the bells and whistles. Fantastic product guys and for the money it's a steal\n",

      "I had an Optoma [UNK] but felt it was lacking the brightness I liked on TV, and I heard that [UNK] was much better. So I returned my [UNK] to Costco and got the [UNK], which is Costco's version of the [UNK]. Wow, \"much better\" hardly describes it! The brightness is incredible, and the detail and colors are truly remarkable. The other night, I was trying out different DVDs just to see what they looked like on the new system, and I was totally blown away. While it does upscale DVD images to look better on its system, I also bought a Sony upscaling DVD player and there is a significant improvement with it with the [UNK] connection. I had read that since they are both upscaling, the DVD player's upscaling wouldn't be necessary, but I do find the image through the upscaling DVD the best in a side-by-side test using two Sony DVD players and two DVDs of the recently restored \"Carousel\" using component, s-video, and [UNK] at the same time, all connected to the [UNK]. I saw clearer detail on faces coming from the [UNK] upscaling DVD player. I was so impressed, I felt like pulling in people from the street to see it, but I fought the impulse because I don't want to share it with anyone. With a little tweaking of the menus, new films like \"Star Wars III\" and \"Sin City\" showed incredible detail, and older films like \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" were gorgeous in their Technicolor glory. I highly recommend the [UNK].\n",

I find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the [UNK] and the professional touch that it brings to the taping. Being able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good [UNK] is a remarkable experience. Another benefit of [UNK]ing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise.

Guess what, it did not work with their program either. [UNK] said they had several complaints with ADS's product. Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work. Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product! P.S.

      "Pros: Perfect [UNK], solved resampling issues Cons: famous popping/[UNK] noises makes it useless for gaming, especially in [UNK] (which use OpenAL by Creative). Crystallizer is useless. This card has the most advanced [UNK] processor which does not work on at least 20% of high end systems, not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset, but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards: see Google for \"X-Fi popping/[UNK]\". Even if you do not have in game [UNK] immediately, you have a good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change. For long time Creative denied existence of this problem. Eventually it was recognized (see official CL forums) and a new driver (since November 2005!) was promised at the end of May 2006, but beta version published 05/30/06 did not solve my problem. In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial \"hacked\" drivers. I suspect that X-Fi [UNK] is an architecture design flow, which cannot be completely solved at software level, because PCI bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the \"the fastest [UNK] processor\" simultaneously with high end graphic card, HD controller, and other devices. Bottom end: I have to stop playing games, or go back to low quality integrated [UNK]. Do not take risk, wait for working drivers, or buy a working card from different manufacturer. With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars. UPDATE 06/12/2006 I found that many desktop motherboards (MB) have really slow south bridge (south bridge is connecting PCI, USB, Firewire, and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge), especially MBs with NVidia chipsets (and even with some Intel MBs). New beta X-Fi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases (but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4G-SATA2, nVidia 6100 / 410 MCP chipset), but situation is still marginal and X-Fi might go unstable again. I contact CL customer service, they did not solved the problem, but pointed out that ATI chipsets (Athlon 64, ATI 200 or 3200) have no problems with X-Fi. I decided not to return SB to seller, but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB. I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCI-X (even NVidia based) also should be fine with X-Fi. The trouble is that majority of X-Fi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me. So I can give X-Fi two stars instead of 1 (but I cannot change the rating), and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release (if it will work)\n",

Sliding the [UNK] in a 2 handed process, so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in. Removing the [UNK] is extremely easy. That's a one-handed process. \"Eject\" the [UNK] from the PC's drive and then remove it. Data transfer from the [UNK] to PC is very quick. Overall, I'm glad to have it, but it's an annoyance to use it. I hate the [UNK] getting stuck halfway in the [UNK]\n",

      "I bought this [UNK] because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had [UNK] inputs for me to hook up my [UNK] player to it. The first unit I received would not turn on at all. I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective [UNK] back to them at my expense. Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead. Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit. The replacement [UNK] arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing. After listening to the [UNK] for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf [UNK] that I own, here are my thoughts. 1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3. Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length. The Philips [UNK], however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception. This did not happen with the Sony [UNK]. 2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3. Playing the same song side-by-side on the two [UNK]s, I found that the Philips [UNK] had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3. The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality. Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips [UNK], making \"S\" sounds sound more like \"H\" sounds. I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the [UNK] input. 3. The ergonomics of the Philips [UNK] are not so good. For one thing, the [UNK] will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped. If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove. The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3. The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening. This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting. Finally, the [UNK] is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it). I am in the process of returning this [UNK], and I will try to find a Sony system instead. Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago. I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly. Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf [UNK]s? The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play [UNK] CDs.\n",

These are 3 way speakers - for really good [UNK] on the cheap - speakers need to be 2 way! 2 - The [UNK] input consists of a headphone type jack in FRONT. Not even standard phono inputs at the back. 3 - Its advertised as 320 watts - which is meaningless - since the speakers suck. What good is a high power [UNK] with crappy speakers.

Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD. I can't comment on other [UNK] brands such as Belkin, but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished [UNK] products but this may be a reflection of [UNK]'s popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a [UNK] then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality [UNK] suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a [UNK] is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge [UNK] for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought [UNK] branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my [UNK] products but it may be a problem with this model.

When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought. She looked at the [UNK] and said okay I'm ready turn it on. I said \"it IS ON!!\" This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it. The image I got for my digital [UNK] was certianly different, but that's all it was, different. It was NOT noticably better. In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse. I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for). So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the [UNK]. It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture. Save your money. If you can't get [UNK] don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing\n",

      "The Good: When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited. I have been playing [UNK] ([UNK] 2) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys. So it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game. The interchangable [UNK] for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that I have seen. But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it. The Bad: The board is constructed well but don't expect this to replace your home [UNK]. The \"Windows Keyset\" that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill [UNK] but it is awkward to type with (I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split [UNK]). In-game typing is difficult at best (with the gaming [UNK]). With most of the gaming [UNK] the keys on the left 1/2 of the [UNK] are laid out like your home [UNK] but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical (not staggered.. like U,J and M keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other). The keys feel a little \"cheap\" .. When you push them down they don't bounce back as much. The Ugly: About 2 weeks after I purchases this board (and the [UNK] keyset) 9 keys went completely dead. I tried to reinstall the software, reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail. I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty base unit. DUH! They are \"reviewing my warranty\" but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day. Maybe this post is premature but I don't think I am getting a new base unit. Conclusion: The expression \"Great Idea, Bad Execution\" holds true here. My opinion: Don't buy this board. Ideazon has too many issues, not enough support staff and a website that doesn't do anything but look good\n",

      "This product looks and feels very flimsy. Do not be fooled by the flashy, metallic-looking picture. The plastic shell of this [UNK] is the quality of McDonald's toys. One would think that for $300, the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting. The buttons are hard to press. In order to turn the [UNK] on, you have to press very firmly, which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell. The [UNK] port for the DocuPen is also extremely flimsy, and you have to hold the [UNK] firmly in place in order for the downloads to take place; otherwise, the connection will be lost. I am a pre-medical student, and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product, believing that I could (for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk) scan my science textbooks in the library, including the colored diagrams, and in that way, I thought I would make back my investment, since textbooks go for at least $100 each. However, I now see that this belief was naive, to say the least. The [UNK] is extremely difficult to use. The words come out distorted, like a jammed fax machine, and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDF's, the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate. Furthermore, downloading is very slow (at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer), and since you can't see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer, you will have to re-scan about 80% of pages due to stretches, smudges, blurriness, suspicious blank spots, and general illegibility. I wish I had read some of the other negative Amazon reviews before buying this product. I would have saved myself a lot of money and time. If you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents, then this product may work okay for you, although a digital camera will probably deliver better results. If you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all-out \"paperless\" with this product, you will find yourself extremely disappointed. Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi-decent shell manufacturuer, it will not a good buy.

After reading up on it and now experiencing it, I think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market. Maybe by a company with better customer service.

More memory is always good but the [UNK] isn't on the hurting side. It's not a good mp3 player with the memory it has. And even if you have a 2G card with mp3's it's not like this is what you would buy for MP3s. But as far as contact information, on the go applications etc.. I would consider this as good as any other. The problem as I have just found out is these are known to die. I haven't heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the [UNK] will at some point Die. It will lock up and even after all the resets listed from [UNK] it will not come back to even a factory state. You will have a [UNK] Powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top. There are a couple of fixes. If you are under warranty you can send it back to [UNK] for them to make it better. Or you can remove the battery and solder it back. This is a serious design issue that [UNK] is more than happy to charge you for. Until I ran into this I would have rated this a 4/5. Until this happened the device did what I expected it to do. I read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no WiFi. But it has one of the fastest processors (available at that time) in a PDA. Which was a different type of cool. The bluetooth works well enough I haven't had any issues with it. You can surf the net with bluetooth so [UNK] isn't really that big of a deal. But if you can't trust your device is going to be working the next day it really doesn't matter what cool feature it has. This has been a very expensive let down.

      "I bought this [UNK] from retailer (offline), and returned it the next day. First off, I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sound. Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger (they use 40mm drivers), the sound quality of the [UNK] was just fine. However, when it comes to wearing these headphones, the only words that come to mind are \"uncomfortable as sin\". The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears (and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation). Also, I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads, but it is nowhere near soft enough... in fact, I litterally couldn't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red (flush) from discomfort. Mind you, I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time, so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either... but these things, they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time, which isn't good at all. Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return. If your ears are tough, you should have no problem with this [UNK]. The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you. However, if you're looking for comfort and good sound isolation, you'll want to look elsewhere..\n",

I didn't think it would be that easy without having to configure something, but it was. Also the menus are very helpful and attractive.

      "I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing. The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.

First off, I am only interested in playing videos from my computer, so I have no idea how well the image [UNK] or MP3 playing works. I also notice other people re[UNK] this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections. My house is fully wired with CAT5, therefore I am using this product wired, not wireless. I was able to get the device connected to my [UNK] and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good. The first thing I did was check for updates. An update was found and updated successfully. I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers. It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed. This unfortunately is the end of the good news. It's all went downhill from here. 1. Neither server, tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie. They listed them as VOB_1, VOB2 etc. So for example, I clicked on my Casablanca folder, I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie. When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes, it did not go to VOB_2. I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play. arrrgghh!! P.O.S. thing. 2. As another review stated, the FF simply does not work properly. Oh, sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward. But there is no way to stop it. If you press play while the movie is FF'wding, the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB. more, arrrrgghh! This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device. Which I will be doing first thing in the morning. My final advice to any prospective buyers: S T A Y A W A Y !!!! My final advic to D-Link, Great idea, but your product absolutely sucks. Oh one more thing, Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly. Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly, their English was terrible. (Guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on, just one guess) It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another. I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients. Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me. She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over. Sheesh, I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right. One last interesting tidbit, on the packaging, they mention Nero recode CE. So I went to the nero site to check it out. Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed. And you know what, D-Link is NOT one of them. I will return this D-Link junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead. I bow my head in shame, As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway.\n",

Every Sharp Aquos LCD [UNK] manufactured before April 1, 2006 shipped with bad [UNK]. What does this mean to you? For me, it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the [UNK] and turning it on, it turned itself off and never turned back on again. Resets, system resets, power cycling, unplugging components didn't help. My [UNK] was completely bricked. A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp [UNK]s in the [UNK] and D6U series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase. For them, the fix was a visit to a Sharp authorized service center to either have the [UNK] replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the [UNK]. I say a \"visit\" because Sharp does not cover in-house technician visits for [UNK]s under 32\", a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled. So here I am, 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no [UNK] to show for it. Instead, it sits at the authorized service center (because Sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either). I'm willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 4/1/2006. Check the serial number on your [UNK] if you do order one. If it begins with a 501-512, 601, 602 or 603, immediately demand a [UNK] upgrade from Sharp (1-800-BE-SHARP), regardless of whether or not you're experiencing these issues; you will eventually, and hopefully while Sharp's warranty is still in effect for you.\n",

      "Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. There is no point in havng one [UNK] [UNK] on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one [UNK]. It would be similar to, say, allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet. In my case I already had two [UNK] [UNK]s related to work when I installed a Netgear [UNK] with [UNK] capabilities on my home [UNK]. The [UNK] software from Netgear stops my other [UNK] [UNK]s working. Added to my woes I can't tell you how often I saw 'the blue screen of death' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts.

      "I was given the iQue M3 for Christmas of 2005. A few months into the new year, I dropped it onto pavement, and it broke. For $99, [UNK] replaced it with a refurbished [UNK], which I consider a fair price. Unfortunately, the refurb [UNK] couldn't play directions at full volume, so I returned it for another refurb. This [UNK] fell off the windshield still in it's cradle, and it started making that frying sound of short circuits. I called [UNK] and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the [UNK], they'd look at it under [UNK]. I had told the guy what happened, so I was pleasantly surprised; they did, in fact, replace it. Under all circumstances, the report you get back says the returned [UNK] was \"within specifications\" (or words to that effect), even though clearly not. I have no idea why. [UNK]s will be returned with new software keys to enter, and the software will begin urging you to register, even though you already have. For some, the mapping software on the M3 will appear crippled. It is a basic drive from here to there [UNK]. It does not allow you to load way-points, Points of Interest, and the like. Each of the [UNK]s had quirks. On the first one, every time I inserted the SD card with maps, Windows player (or whatever it's called) would start up and ask me if I wanted to search the card for tunes. The second one had inaudible volume. The fourth one has a problem common to the first one: The brightness resets itself randomly to zero. Yep, zero. The first one left the powered brightness full on, so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on, but this one resets them both to zero. So you may think the [UNK] is not turning on, but it's on. You just can't see anything on the screen. If you're outside, you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting, but if it's dark, you need a flashlight. The current one will do a hard reset if I start the car with the [UNK] plugged into the lighter and sometimes when I put it in the cradle. This means I have to do the full new user routine. Touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone. After I've gone through the restart routine, the [UNK] will then find the satellites and get me where I'm going, but I can't load destinations from contacts, as they're gone, so I have to type them all in by hand. If the battery runs out of juice, the [UNK] is dead. It forgets everything, and I have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone. I complained about this to support at [UNK], and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and that [UNK] can do nothing about it. They recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an SD card where it will not be lost. So now I carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data. I did learn, though, that if the battery runs down, the backup program is lost, so you can't retrieve your data from the backup SD card unless you have told the program to save as self-extracting archives. I learned it the hard way, of course. To restore, I pop out the detailed maps SD card, insert the backup card, navigate to the File Explorer, navigate to the SD card, open the contents of the SD card, select the latest back up, click through the restore procedure, click to OK that it has finished (just a minute or two with my small amount of data), click to restart, wait a long time for it to restart, tap to get past the owner data screen, enter the password, then pop the restore card out, reinstall the map card, wait while it reads it, then I'm good to go. I can't do it while I'm driving, of course, so if the [UNK] resets on its own, I just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the [UNK] knowing where \"Home\" is, which means I have to type it or other locations into the Where To dialogue. The [UNK] defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up, which is confusing for me as I can't look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where I am vis-a-vis the map. I'm sure this is my shortcoming, and I then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up, which I can't do while driving. It also defaults to different displays for day and night. The night display uses a dark background, and I have found that the menus for the Windows programs use a transparent background with black text. So I can't read the menu selections against the dark display. And the [UNK] will not save my preference for using day at all times if I lose power or the [UNK] resets when I start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle. On the contacts database, the [UNK] assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. It also formats all numbers as US numbers. I have a few overseas numbers, and they are crammed into the (xxx) xxx-xxxx format, even though they are longer and don't start with an area code. In the calendar, if I have meetings scheduled outside my time zone, I enter them at the time they're scheduled. Then when I get there, I have the option of choosing the visited time zone, and all the times are screwed up, as the [UNK] assumes all times entered are for my original time zone. So I never use the visited time zone feature, and the [UNK] assumes I'm still in my home zone wherever I may travel. I have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address, but for which I have the lat/long coordinates. I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads - I quickly lose where I am and have to zoom out, which loses the road. On the whole, the directions part of the M3 is excellent. It gives good directions, has reasonably up to date maps, and lets you find stores, restaurants, gas stations, hotels, and the like in your area, and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations. On the whole, using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper. After a year of use, I can't put up with it anymore. I'll take [UNK]'s word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows Mobile and not [UNK]'s fault, but I can't put up with it anymore. I'll switch to Magellan or TomTom or some other [UNK] that isn't Windows-based and that doesn't completely lose its mind when the battery runs down, doesn't randomly do a hard reset, doesn't randomly set the brightness to zero, and doesn't assume all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. Maybe another manufacturer will let me import POIs and way-points from other people's files\n",

      "DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I have Directv with [UNK] (5 [UNK]) and the signal was low.

Also, on [UNK], if hands are near the [UNK], the signal breaks up(for weaker signals, not strong ones), and compared to my Grundig 400-PE, which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the [UNK] is bothersome, the Eton E-5 seems worse still!!!

So you don't see it prior to opening the package. Once the package is opened it is a mess that probably cannot be returned. Lastly, this is one of the worst [UNK] jobs I have seen. The plastic clamshell is so hard to open that I think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors. The cut plastic is also dangerous\n",

      "I bought this [UNK] [UNK] today (April 7, 2007) at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $10. I wish I had seen the reviews first. I bought it because of the product name, small size and variety of options. Unfortunately, I realized it wasn't a great buy when I brought it home...and spent a few hours trying to keep the [UNK] in a certain position so the [UNK] would stay on. The connections appear to be very sensitive and the [UNK] doesn't stay in place. The [UNK] light is pointless. It's supposed to help you see the time in the dark, but unless you have the [UNK] at a certain angle everything will appear blurry. Actually, the screen is blurry in most positions even with the light off. As for the [UNK], it's pretty quiet. If you're a sound [UNK] or live in a noisy environment, this is not the [UNK] for you. You'll only hear the [UNK] if you sleep with it under your ear. A final note on this product: The [UNK] has been on for almost an hour without any problems...but only with the [UNK] cover slightly open. If I close the cover all the way, the [UNK] shuts off. If you want an [UNK] [UNK] that will last awhile, I suggest buying something else. You get less than you pay for with this model.\n",

      "I purchased the 8GB Creative [UNK] V Plus player during the first week in February. I am returning it and this is why: The package arrived from Amazon. I loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord. I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state. Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player. So after the music was loaded, I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music. The sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc... The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player. I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there. So I plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer. The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player. I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there. Then I accessed through the computer just fine. All my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd's. The player just wouldn't read about half my songs. There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize. I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks. This happened with my entire music collection. So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update. It did not solve the problem. I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the [UNK] V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original [UNK] Shuffle and they played just fine. I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service. It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why. They have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company I have ever spoke with. After three calls, never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, I arrived nowhere. They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem. No email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place. So I tried a fourth call. This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand, saying \"I can't believe you Americans\" and then mumbled something in another language. I asked for a supervisor. He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days. Then he hung up. I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature. They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way. So I am returning the Creative [UNK] V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again. By the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed. Also, when doing research on this product, I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files. This is not true. This player will not play any files without being converted first. I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file. The format they use is absolutely a waste of space. If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format, it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more. I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie. I was wrong, the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted. I would not recommend this product to anyone. As much as I don't like the IPod, I would recommend it over the [UNK] V Plus because: 1. It plays all my music 2.

I listened to it quite a bit and the battery stayed almost at a full charge. Fast Foward Week 2 I wanted to delete some files and add some new ones. I opened up the media player and did the exact same thing as I did at first. First, the program began running really slow and then froze. I ctr/alt delete and started over. It worked for a second and then froze again. I rebooted and it did the same thing. I came back to it the next day and it did it again. I uninstalled it (so I thought), and it continued to freeze. It doesn't completely uninstall off of your computer. I know this because I didn't have to \"re-authorize\" my computer to use it again. I had to manually go in and find it and remove it from my computer. There are lots of hidden files. In conclusion, had it not been for my experience with the [UNK] I would have kept the player.\n",

The K3 [UNK]s are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted. It took three calls to [UNK] and replacing the ICC profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the K3 [UNK] compatibility with the plain paper. All the magazines raved about the Black and White [UNK] quality. NOT. At least not on Premium Quality Photo Paper. Perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers. I saw very little improvement over my [UNK] R320. Now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo [UNK] then this is very nice [UNK]. The biggest drawback is you will not find the [UNK] cartridges at any major store such as Staples. The in stock [UNK] guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore. This is Hint #1. Hint #2 if you run out of [UNK] on a weekend and need to have something for Monday you are SOL. The only option you have is to order the [UNK] online. Trust Amazon as they can find and deliver. However if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges. Cartridges certainly dont last very long and at $12-$15 each with eight of them your burning $100-$125 a set. Bulk [UNK] tanks are coming out but I doubt the K3 [UNK]s will be imitated.

I have a [UNK] Bravia XBR3, Oppo upconverting DVD player, Scientific Atlanta HD box and Nintendo Wii game console. This unit only offers pass-through video, so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the [UNK] for each type of input ([UNK], component, etc.). For the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection, you'll pay in extra cabling costs. The [UNK] on this unit carries video only - no sound - so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your DVD or [UNK] to the receiver, and then from the receiver to your [UNK]. Again, major inconvenience and lots of additional connections. The manual for this unit is beyond terrible. I'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like [UNK] would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one. For example, there was a hum when watching [UNK] that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not - some are shielded and some aren't. Nothing in the manual about this. There are probably just enough [UNK] and component connections for the basic user like myself. Plus side is that there is no DVD player with this, so I can use my own. Given a chance to do this again, I would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output\n",

      "In short, why a 1 Star Rating you wonder? Took forever to set up properly; long wait time and poor help from tech support; automatic set-up I doubt will ever work for anyone. Though it does work once finally set up. __________________________________________________________ So I decided to go [UNK] at home with a new laptop, new [UNK] [UNK], and a [UNK] print server (PS), so I can put the [UNK] in the garage and free up space in the house. I did a lot of research and decided to get a Belkin [UNK] (F5D7231-4) and this PS from the same manufacturer so hopefully they would set-up easily together. This is definitely not the case! First be warned this product IS NOT [UNK] compatible! Thus, even though the [UNK] is [UNK] able, you cannot use [UNK] with the PS and thus have to use WEP for the network once this product is used. Hopefully in the future this product will support [UNK], but it would only hopefully do so thru a Firmware Upgrade. Do not think this PS is [UNK] compatible. Next, be warned the box says \"3 Minute Easy Install\" - well it took me about 12 hours total to get the PS working now [UNK]ly. I am not a computer techie, but I am smart, a great problem solver, and savvy enough to teach myself how to create a whole html website with hundreds of pages. I tried to set-up the PS on a static IP address, as recommended by my techie friends, but this just did not happen. Thus, next time I restart the [UNK] it may assign the PS a different IP address and then I'll have to find it thru the [UNK] interface and reconfigure the [UNK] set-up for that new address-so I plan to spend more time in the future revisiting this issue. The crux of how I got it to work is by using the [UNK] interface and entering the MAC addresses of the PS and computers in the network. This is the golden key I searched for for hours trying all permutations of all the other settings in the [UNK]'s and PS's web interfaces. Only this way was I able to unhook the LANd-line from the PS to the [UNK] and get it to interface and thus work [UNK]ly. Belkin tech support had medium wait time, friendly techs (not always speaking English without thick accents though), and they were unable to solve my golden key for me. They even promised a chief tech would call me back but that never happened. So, yes, the product works fine but just be warned from someone perhaps like yourself that I had to learn way more about this whole network/configuration issue than I ever wanted or expected to, and I had to manually configure the whole set-up to get this product to work.\n",

Unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical, jazz and any other type of [UNK] with any quiet passages VERY FRUSTRATING. During the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car [UNK] to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal. I haven't measured it but it seems like as little a 10-15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior. This makes this unit useless for classical [UNK] and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles.

      "I got this case for my WS-320M, which I've been wearing around my neck like a MP3 player. The material of the case seems to be genuine leather (or really good vinyl) and brushed felt. It looks good = professional looking. I've enclosed what I hope are representative pictures of this case. All the buttons of the [UNK] are accessible. Even when the flap is closed, the [UNK]/headphone jacks are available, as are the REC/STOP/PLAY buttons. If the 2 tiny holes on top of the [UNK] are apertures for the built-in [UNK], you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well. There is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the \"HOLD\" button on the side of the [UNK]. Not only does this prevent the [UNK] from jostling around, but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the \"HOLD\" button. However, since the HOLD button is meant to slide down (away from the [UNK]) for it to be released, if the [UNK] was accidently pulled out of the case, the resulting friction would actually unlock the \"HOLD\" button. The belt loop is an adjustable velcro. I would have preferred a sewn-on belt loop (so the case cannot come off the belt accidently) or a nice stiff clip (for easy access), or even a riveted snap button, but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options. Most of this opinion of mine is probably based on my bias against in velcro in general - they seem to be just weak enough to cause problems at the most inopportune times. The case is closed shut with another velcro strap, All in all, it seems to be designed to merely protect the surface of the [UNK] during transport. Or, being able to put it on your belt AFTER everything else (line-in [UNK], headphone, recording/playing) is set up. The relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the [UNK] is inside the case (mainly due to very small buttons), as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand, would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the [UNK] inside the case. The case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket, and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the [UNK]. My bias lies in that I like to use it as an MP3 player, and I wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap/loop from a flash drive. Placing the [UNK] on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone/[UNK] to fall out from the waving of arms and such. I think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt.

The timbre match was slightly off and the vocals were not as sharp as they are with my [UNK] CSi3 but it was not awful. My bottom line - you can certainly buy a better center channel [UNK]. Can you buy a better one in this price range. I think so - if you are only focused on the quality of this one [UNK] and not the blended sound of your system.

So last year, I purchased a [UNK] center [UNK] and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane. The [UNK] [UNK] which costs the same as the [UNK] ($199) was far and away the better product. The sound is cleaner, crisper, sharper...it made watching movies much more enjoyable. I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on all these years.

Depending on who you ask, the center [UNK] is the most important [UNK] in a home entertainment audio system.

      "I have owned the DMR-[UNK] for over 6 months. It is a combo [UNK]/[UNK] unit. I have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit. The MANUAL: It is imperative to have the manual. This machine is somewhat complicated, and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary. If everything is working correctly, you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it. It is overly time-consuming though, since the items don't seem to logically flow. If you dig long and hard enough though, they are in there somewhere. The SET-UP: Being somewhat experienced at setting-up a home theater, this was generally easy. The text and pictures were sufficient. Searching through the Function Menu, I learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons. This is needlessly confusing. Of course the auto clock set function isn't very accurate ( I haven't seen an accurate one yet). [UNK] [UNK]: The general [UNK] is pretty straight-forward. I really miss some of the extra [UNK] features that are on my [UNK] progressive player (which is 3 years older). Finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult. A Zoom feature is missing. Many convenience features are not present. [UNK] RECORDING: Recording onto a [UNK]-RAM disc is a dream compared to old fashioned [UNK] tapes. I really enjoy using them. A quirk--you must have the unit in stand-by to record from the scheduler. This mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another(on the same disc) you must wait until the unit begins recording, then select the show to watch from the Navigator. The UHF tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel 19. Other weak channels record but not 19. This problem started about 6 months after initial set-up. There is an annoying bug with Daylight Savings Time, and the newer extended time period. The Panasonic Web Site suggests going into the set-up menu and unchecking the DST box; thus removing the feature. If this did anything, it would allow you to set the clock manually. Being without the automatic DST adjustment would not be annoying, but even though you turn-off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at 7pm EST. This ruins any TV scheduling you had set. This malady persisted until the date of the former DST Spring-Ahead arrived. Several weeks of scheduling hell! I requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised. No message, no number to call--just a promise to call again when I was home. THE [UNK] USE: This feature is really buggy. You are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote; but this only worked for a month or two. When a TV show is scheduled for recording the unit won't tape it if you merely insert a cassette. It doesn't recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move--either playing a little or fast forwarding/reversing. This is really annoying. LAST IMPRESSION: The last movie (Last King of Scotland) I watched took over the machine. The remote control would not function, the disc would not stop, and the disc could not be ejected. It was necessary to unplug the unit, restart it, eject the disc, and totally reset all menu items--which were randomly reset to various settings. Worse some settings are no longer selectable. One other movie would not even play in the machine--forcing me to use the trusty [UNK] unit. I must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what I read at this forum and other ones. These units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption. I recommend looking elsewhere.\n",

      "The write up sounds good, with many options and features, but after closer examination I had to take it back. First thing, it appears that the front DV plug was an after-thought for Panasonic, it's a rinky-dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main AV/S plugs are located. This is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit, retro fitting it in wherever. The tiny \"[UNK] within a [UNK]\" toggle [UNK] for fastforward, reverse, etc looks like it's glued on, it won't last long with normal use, and it's hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit. The [UNK] interface is difficult to navigate. The remote control is horrible, a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the [UNK]s to figure out what [UNK] to push for each of the basic and most used features.

I found the keys did not always respond leaving me with multiple errors to fix in every paragraph and the split space bar has been a constant source of irritation, I usually hit the solid piece of plastic in the middle instead of one of the keys. The little plastic arms on the stand do not hold the PDA at all securely, even bumping the table can knock it off, and I have taken to using an elastic band to keep my IPAQ in place. The \"mouse\" [UNK] is a nice idea but does not justify the loss of the arrow keys.

      "Malfunctions: 1. The port for connecting to a PC became loose and unreliable, frequently disconnecting while I was trying to transfer [UNK]. 2.

It's nice that you can delete [UNK] on the player without having to connect it to a computer, for instance if you have it on shuffle and you come across something that you never want to hear again. However, the interface to do this was so inconvenient (including audio [UNK] stopping and long lag times) that I rarely used this feature in practice. The earbuds that come with it didn't stay in my ears well; I bought new ones. Good things: I loved the fact that it had an FM radio and a voice recorder (the reasons that I bought it). It's easy to access the hard drive from any computer, without any software needed. The large storage capacity proved fully necessary. You can change [UNK] modes with a single button press (shuffle versus ordered, all songs versus current folder only).

      "The only good thing about this product is its price (I saw it being sold at $160 on some other site). There are several shortcomings though: - The greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu. There is no 'home location'. Also there are only two [UNK] options available - shortest time & shortest distance. So if you are caught in a traffic jam for example, there is no 'detour' function. Also, you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating. Hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa. - The maps are probably very old. I used this device in NJ, VA & MN. In every state, I faced problems multiple times, when the unit did not know that the [UNK] bifurcated ahead & it would not tell me to keep on left/right, or it would ask me take turns when there were none. - The unit was very slow in calculating routes (I dont know how the Sirf Star III chip helps). Also it would freeze often & I would need to reset it at critical junctions. - The viaMichellin website is only dedicated to Europe. When I went to register my product, I had to register it in viaMichellin UK, since there was no option for US! I dont think they have any support for the US models. - The POIs are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range.

      "I really tried to like the Via [UNK], bought it with every intention of loving it in March 2007. But I feel compelled to tell most of you to \"keep shopping.\" I bought it due to the excellent price, small thin size(compared to [UNK]). I thought \"how bad can it be?\" I ordered it and had it shipped to my door, then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it. This is because my other [UNK] units were in other cars, with other family members already on other trips. I bought this one as a budget [UNK], optimistic that it was new and had the Sirf-III chip. But before long, I hated this unit, all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me, and I will tell you about it below. First, please note there are a few positive reviews for this unit....but have you noticed they are mostly all people who have no experience with \"Other\" [UNK] units? Or they didn't spend much time with it before they reviewed it? Or they haven't had experience with [UNK] in 4 years..which is like a century in terms of how fast this technology is changing? For positive reviewers, if this is their first \"newer\" [UNK] and if they are comparing it to a Car navigational [UNK] Of 4 years ago, then yes, it is quite a bit better. But compared to the new units like Mio 310x or the Tom Tom One (both of which I own) then the Via[UNK] has a \"horrible\" user interface, and is horrible to use on the roads. Tomtom and Mio, often finish what you are typing for you, they are intuitive and programmers have polished them. But the Via[UNK] is very non intuitive, absolutely dangerous to try to use on the fly. Sure, we are not supposed to use them while we drive, and with this one it is TRULY dangerous even when you learn the complicated system. So most of the time, you have to pull over and work on it. But it is no fun, and even you program it, if you go to another screen it \"loses\" it and you have to program the history all over. You will soon be frustrated with how many steps this unit takes to do anything, and how \"lost\" it often gets. I will try to give you the pros: Pros: Small form factor, decent screen, SIRF 3 chip. NAVteq maps. Four hour battery life. Good price for a Sirf-3 chip unit. Cons: Horrible non intuitive software program, clunky, multi step interface that will make your life horrible if you are in a rush or emergency...or even if you are not in a hurry. Horrible speaker..volume so poor and speaker so poor, you CAN'T hear it with any road noise present...seriously...turn speaker up all the way while driving..it will crackle and is illegible. I read this in a review, but honestly didn't believe it until I owned it. Third, unlike ANY [UNK] I've had, this one literally tells you to \"start driving\" before it can tell you which way to go, when you've routed it to the nearest store, etc. Think about that! It means sometimes you have a 50% chance of making the right choice as to which way to go...then if you guess wrong, it tells you to turn around and go the other way! Seriously...that one feature should be enough to make you say \"NO\" as most [UNK] will at least tell you to \"turn right\" from where you are parked or \"turn left\" but this one will say \"start driving\" without ANY direction....because it can't seem to route until you drive onto a road. It can't do it from a parking lot! It already will have the satellite location...that's not it..it's a software bugaboo I think built into the programming. It makes you \"start driving\" because it can't find your location or know which way you are going..until you start and it routes the direction you are traveling. Bad software design for sure. When you go to Canada, you have to have installed (on another SD card) the Canadian map....very inconvenient when you cross the border. Navteq maps could not find many locations on coastal Maine. Literally, we were driving on coastal roads it said did not exist. I found it VERY slow recalculating trips when you missed a turn (MUCH slower than my Mio 310 which was purchasd last year, or TOM TOM ONe which was purchased this year) and this recalculation problem in busy city traffic, caused us to miss several critical exits. Want to find POI's on the run? Forget it. Too many steps and illogical organization compared to other major brands. It often could not find even local Walmarts...one's that have been there for 20 years. I'm serious. I parked in front of Walmarts that it could not find...very old Walmarts. To be sure, [UNK], TomTom and Mio do not list ALL Walmarts, but at least they get 4 or 5 out of 7 in my home town. Not so Via. In several towns in Maine and Connecticut, I parked in front of rows of old stores that had been there for years. Punch in local stores on the difficult to use POI list, and it can't find any of them. Also, punch in or look for stores like nearest Walmart....Mio and Tom Tom had no problems finding several..or the nearest ones it knew about from your location. But with Via, it has to be within a certain distance from you..or it will not show up as existing. So....you then have to figure out the next town and search from that location, to try to find the store. Very, very clunky....can't tell you how much trouble that is. It's so simple on the other units, you get spoiled with the [UNK] or TomToms. This one makes it so hard and still can't find the POI's. No [UNK] finds all stores....there is a limit on POI's, of course. But it seems the Via programmers spent their time gathering addresses for BANK ATM's and not restaurants, shopping, etc. Believe me, once you've used it on a trip, it's organized to make you believe the programmers never actually used a [UNK] themselves before. I can't say enough about how \"difficult\" the interface is....and when you go \"back\" or \"forward\" to another screen, it often loses where it is...and you have to start all over again programming where you are going, going through multiple difficult steps. When you lose power, again, you start all over. When I bought it, I read some of the negative and positive reviews and thought....how bad can it be? I thought the complaining people are probably not techie and are complaining for no reason. WRONG! The experienced [UNK] users are the ones that know just how clunky and bad this software interface is compared to the sleek [UNK] or Tom Tom interfaces. Example: On one trip, my daughter began to throw up, and we had to find an emergency medical treatment facility....this clunky interface made it very difficult to locate one. When you are panicked, you want to quickly find the nearest hospital. This unit makes you put in the town, etc. if you are further than x miles or so...like when you are on the interstate....so you are literally guessing which town to search to find a hospital. Which is horrible. I had this happen before and with the Mio, about 3 clicks and BAM you have searched and found the nearest hospital...one more click and you are routed to the nearest hospital. Truly, I am sad to not recommend the Via[UNK]. I really recommend you \"pass\" like some other reviewers have suggested. And I recommend you to buy the more rapid, easy to use Mio with the great screen, blazing fast Sirf 3 and calculating chip, and loud-clear-speaker. If you are tech challenged, buy the [UNK] or TomTom's with their awesome and easy to use software interface. But don't buy this bad speakered, horrible interfaced, poorly designed, buggy unit. On paper, it looks like a killer unit. But in reality, it is an unpolished clunky paper tiger that is horrible to use. Finally, there is the \"fun\" factor. The TomTom One is fun. The Mio is fast and fun, a pleasure to use! Even the newer [UNK]'s are fun with their simplicity (I hated the screen on some of the old [UNK]s.) But the Via[UNK] X-930 has no fun programmed in....it is not a pleasure to use, although it will take you across country. Believe me, the pleasure of the low price will quickly fade once you start working with the unhearable speaker, unpolished, unfun, clunky, interface with poorly organized features and disorganized POI's and menus. The polished quick intuitive menu is where [UNK] and TomTom shine. The only thing better on the ViaMichellin is the screen and Sirf-chip...some of the older [UNK]'s use an older satellite [UNK] chip than the ViaMichellin, but new tomtom's and Via use the same [UNK] satellite chip, but faster software routines and cpu chips. But even the use of the Sirf-3 chip on the Via [UNK], cannot make up for the poor software and menu design. Theoretically, this thing should be blazing fast, but it is much slower than my TomTom or Mio. The only thing better on this unit than the Mio, is that the Via is smaller and thinner. And maybe the Navteq maps might be slightly better for some locals. But other than that, the Mio wins hands down, by far a faster, better and easier to use [UNK] in my opinion. If you are looking for software ease, go [UNK] first, then Tom-Tom, then Mio, and Via last. If you are looking for value in a great unit then go with the Mio 310x, it's a killer unit and it's hackable. But if you are looking for simplicity i programming where you are going, go with [UNK] first, then Tom-tom. I tried you Mr. Via[UNK], but you need to go to \"finishing school\" like the other [UNK] students. You are just too unfinished and rough\n",

      "The [UNK] bus does not have the [UNK] to get you [UNK] speed. You will be very lucky if you can get 300 megabit speeds on a [UNK] [UNK] card, even with jumbo frames. Your [UNK] has two [UNK] busses, and sometimes has three. Depending on the chipset and the manufacturer, the internal devices like the keyboard/mouse/floppy, internal network, USB, Firewire, and more, will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses. You will have to run SiSoft Sandra or [UNK]tweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the [UNK] [UNK] it can get, but that will not be close to [UNK] speed, either. Best case on 33 MHz [UNK] is 300 megabit. Even if you can find which [UNK] bus has the fewest [UNK]-consuming devices on it, the 33 MHz [UNK] busses in all consumer PCs cannot handle the [UNK] of this (or any) [UNK] card, anyway. If you want true [UNK] speed get a [UNK] that has built-in [UNK] or get a [UNK] with 66 MHz [UNK], [UNK]-X (not [UNK] Express), 64-bit [UNK], or similar, but you're going to pay lots of money for that. Worse yet that built-in [UNK] interface might still be on a 33 MHz [UNK] bus and always sharing bandwith, giving you less than 300 megabit speed. It probably shares with other devices so you have to do your homework\n",

I'm pretty sure that it's inability to be repaired is just a marketing ploy so you will buy another. The only good qualities these earphones have is their sound quality, and their comfort.

I returned it and received very promptly a new unit which at least functioned. As far as being functional that is another story. I proceed to try to use the it in either using the memory in the [UNK] itself or using it directly connected to the computer. Either way the unit produced images that were useless. The lines that look fine on the paper [UNK] were incomplete or missing in the digital version. Drawing a straight line was impossible even with the help of a straight edge.

I purchased this for my wife thinking that it would be a nice compact simple [UNK] to operate where we could easily print pictures of the grandkids. She and I both have newer Nikon digitals and the [UNK] connection will not work with mine at all. With hers, we can make a connection and, following drections carefully, we can get it to 'energize' the [UNK] but the [UNK] will only print intermittent photos and not of good quality. The [UNK] will not pull the paper though properly. (We have even changed batteries in the camera to no avail and had a tech savvy son-in-law look at it.)

      "I've found the [UNK] (v2.0) to be very problematic. With [UNK] version 1.50.18, some distributed network software such as [UNK] will cause the [UNK] to reboot itself every 5 minutes, bringing down the entire net. With the newer [UNK] version 1.52.10 it fixes this problem, but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server (passthru tcp port 80), making the [UNK] totally unusable. Tech support was friendly and helpful, and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the [UNK] to 1.50.18 for our websites, and upgrade each time to 1.52.10 whenever we had the need for distributed [UNK]. So now we upgrade/downgrade the [UNK] sometimes several times in a single week, and each time we do it brings down our net. I've also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands. You cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its MAC address. Instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips. Also, it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number, even though they map to two different computers. This makes it impossible, for example, to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time\n",

      "I've rarely had bad experiences with Microsoft mice or keyboards. Usually they tend to have above average design and put thought into the product. They evidently didn't hire the \"good\" designer to work on this product however as this [UNK] has 2 glaring faults. #1: The shallow height and shape of the [UNK] is such that it offers no support for your hand whatsoever. This causes hand strain and inconsistent hand placement as you use it. You never get the feeling that your hand is in \"the right position\". #2: The side buttons are in brain dead locations. Why this is I have no idea, as other Microsoft models put the left side button right where your [UNK] would be if you move your [UNK] up slightly (the way it should be). On this \"gaming\" [UNK] the left [UNK] button is much too far forward causing you to have to practically re-adjust your grip on the [UNK] just to press it. Couple this with problem #1 and the lack of surface contact with your hand causes the [UNK] to skew under your hand as you press the button thus turning your player to one side when you didn't intend to. Just what you don't want when throwing a grenade. The right button is sort of click-able with your pinky and is actually the more accessible button, but it feels more due to luck than planning. I have to wonder if they even tested this design with any gamers at all before putting it out on the street. I give it 2 stars because for the attempt at wireless feel with the thin cord, and it looks visually appealing.

      "Consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in [UNK] DLP televisions. Cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing. (As a non-techniocal person I should have no idea what these parts are, but alas, I bought a [UNK] DLP) Expect these to fail within 1-2 years. Expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan. That is, if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere. These parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates. You should also expect the [UNK] to fail sooner than advertized. Many people need to purchase a new [UNK] between 1-2 years, and some more often than that. The [UNK] [UNK]s approx $150-$250 depending on your model, but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty. This [UNK] will be in addition to [UNK] [UNK]s for the color wheel and colling fan. Please remember that these maintenance [UNK]s are recurring, and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years. While I was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my DLP, my color wheel failed very early. I called tech support to report a grinding noise, and was told to \"turn it off\", wait 15 minutes, and turn it back on like this would fix the problem. After doing this for a while, the color wheel finally failed, actually shattered! Now I am out of warranty, and [UNK] wants nothing to do with me. I have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors, and they are both backordered indefinitely! It has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available. [UNK] cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of [UNK] parts is expected to meet demand.

IT WILL SAVE YOU A TON, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CIRCUIT CITY TECH TO FIND PARTS WHICH MAY TAKE MONTHS!

      "Specs look good. [UNK] 1.3a, 1080p, firmware upgrade over Ethernet, etc. The unit seems to be solid (heavy) and well built. However, Toshiba chose to ship this [UNK]-DVD player with only a composite A/V cable (yellow, red, white RCA jacks) in the box. The best resolution you can get with this cable is 480i, and not even as good as an S-Video connection for that! It is pretty amazing that a high-end consumer electronics device which is advertised for its high-definition capabilities and [UNK] 1.3a interface is being shipped without a cable set (component video or [UNK]) that actually makes it possible for the customer to connect it to an [UNK]. I don't know how much cost savings Toshiba gets out of not including a cable that costs less than $5. Now let's get to the real review: Pros: - One of the best features of this unit is its capability to upscale regular DVDs to 1080p. The upscaling is very high quality. The unit also has various noise reduction options that help with some of the poorly mastered DVDs. - If the weight of the unit is any indication, build quality is high. - It has an Ethernet port for firmware updates (and possible future functionality) Cons: - Very slow boot time. Takes longer to boot than my Windows XP PC. - Especially durimg 1080P [UNK]-DVD playback, the unit gets very hot. Make sure your enclosure/rack is open in the back. There is a somewhat loud fan unit in the back of the player. - This player has no zoom/scaling functions for dealing with non-anomorphic DVDs, so you have to use your TVs scaling function. Kind of a pain since the image quality suffers when the video has to go through two parallel scalers\n",

      "A terrific idea: Show the current time AND the [UNK] times all at once. Very intuitive, very helpful. Unfortunately, the backlit LCD [UNK] just doesn't make the grade. The numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable. The manufacturer's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear, but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic. The numbers just wash out. It's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer's image and from the unit I got. I think that would be a slight improvement, because on the one I got, the orange (backlighting the [UNK] times) is about twice as bright as the green (backlighting the current time), and it just looks weird. Also, FM radio [UNK] is quite poor. The line cord is supposed to serve as the [UNK], but that just doesn't work well no matter how I orient the cord.

At first I thought that maybe if you do that then the [UNK] wont have to be on to have sound output to your TV or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well. [UNK] is supposed to make it more convenient, 1 cable etc... why is this necessary??????? Secondly my [UNK] is not working properly. The sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled 99% of the time. Running the auto MACC fails out, manually I see that it outputs [UNK] right speaker to the front right speaker????? Nothing is hooked up to this output on the [UNK] so nothing should be outputting at all during this part, [UNK] left is silent as it should be. Occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out 3 times louder then it supposed to be. Adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm.

I am current in process to return my faulty [UNK] for a replacement as I do think the [UNK] is nice if its working, I enjoy the IPOD dock that has output to your tv as well.

      "I bought this [UNK] to use as a [UNK] in my system. I based my decision on information as stated on the [UNK] web site, and the attractive price compared to some of the other options I considered. This [UNK] does have a number of good features, but has one serious flaw. It will not display on screen status messages for daily operations, like volume and sound mode, unless you have a [UNK] display, and run another special cable from the [UNK] to the [UNK] (As a side note, [UNK] needs to understand we want to run LESS cables to our display). That means you only get to see the simple set-up screen on your non-[UNK] [UNK], which you will probably use when you first set up the [UNK], and very infrequently after that. (The set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs, and audio calibtraion.) Sounds like a small deal, but in many home theaters, including mine, the electronics are not in the line of site (mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything.) This not uncommon, many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors, and it means I have no idea what the volume is, what sound mode I am using, or anything beyond the set-up menu unless I go into the closet. BAD, BAD, BAD! This seems to be a marketing ploy by [UNK] to get you to buy [UNK] [UNK]'s and projectors, and it is beyond stupid. If this was not the case I would rate this [UNK] much higher, but it is a SERIOUS flaw. It makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult. This limitation also means, if you have mulitple displays, I have a plasma [UNK] and projector in my theater, you need to run thier special cable to both displays, and both have to be [UNK]. Again, I have to say BAD, BAD, BAD! The other features are as stated on the [UNK] website, but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display, and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the [UNK] in the line of site when using thier systems, unless they have a [UNK] display with SR+. (Oh yeah, your [UNK] display has to be also be equipped with SR+, thier way of linking the two units. If your [UNK] display is not equipped with SR+, you are again out of luck. Did I mention this is BAD?!) 25 Feb 2007 - addition to reveiw: I called Onecall and they will take unit back, but at 15% restocking fee, plus paying for shipping both ways. While Onecall really did nothing wrong ([UNK] is lying about the OSD!), it is one of thier vendors and not the customer's fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud.

      "I am glad I purchased my [UNK]scan 700, but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all. My impression is that this is the best product on the market, due to its [UNK] properties, which are quite good. There are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed, and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless, since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place. PROs: It does a pretty good job of [UNK]. The algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive. Even [UNK]s that catch and rotate as they go through, producing a funny smeared image, have some of their contents scanned correctly. The superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product. There is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up [UNK]s. Operationally the product is especially nice- I can just sit there feeding [UNK]s in and typing carriage return after each one, glancing at the screen to catch errors. The [UNK] image is retained in the record in the [UNK]scan database, which is important. CONs: 1) the exit path has places that [UNK]s can hang up, and they can catch as they go through. This happens fairly often unless the [UNK] is new and flat, so part of the operation is to try to prevent that, by straightening out bent corners ahead of time, and by adding a little force keep the [UNK] from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck. Quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous, this wouldn't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case. 2) Although the product retains the image of the business [UNK], there's no way to pass that through to Outlook or export it to any other format. This is very unfortunate. I could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one, except that [UNK]scan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image. Why not? It's easy to implement. 3) Every time I start the program it harasses me about registering, even though I've been specific that I do not wish to. It also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though I've asked it not to do that. It therefore ignores the user wishes. 4) The data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file, in a simple text or csv format. There is no way to create an Outlook format .pst file, which would simplify importing, and allow for the future option of including an image. Outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record, but apparently [UNK]scan folks aren't even close to thinking about this. 5) If I indicate that a data export for a file is destined for Outlook, the field names are not set up correctly, so unless I do some heavy editing of field names, nothing much other than the contact name gets across. If I export directly to the running Outlook program, it isn't perfect, but it's close enough to be usable. Why did [UNK]scan get one right and not the other?? In neither case can I send the [UNK] image over. 6) I was forced to install Microsoft .NET software even though I intended to do all my exports via files. I didn't get a choice- if I didn't install .NET, the installer stopped and exited without installing any [UNK]scan software.\n",

      "I bought my wife a [UNK] 350 for her birthday last August (overall, we love the [UNK], but the [UNK]...no). The biggest \"advantage\" of the [UNK] over other GPS systems is its portability. Unfortunately, the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. The cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the [UNK] and was very difficult to reattach to another [UNK] (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it). What this means is that you need a [UNK] for each [UNK] you want to use this in. The [UNK] and the charging/power wire (which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the [UNK]) are pretty darn expensive ($60-70) which is ridiculous for a \"portable\" system\n",

      "I do not think [UNK] cup [UNK]s work very well. This one is no exception. While attaching and detaching my [UNK] [UNK] is easy enough, the cup does not support the weight. I was disappointed that a Friction bag was not available for my [UNK]. However, I was able to Jury-rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise. I ordered the Friction [UNK], removed the screws on the bottom, detaching the [UNK]s that would not fit my [UNK], and stapled velcro strips purchased at Walmart across the base of the [UNK] cup into the friction [UNK]. I have been cross country using this system and it works. the [UNK] Portable Friction [UNK] for GPS 010-10306-00 combined with the [UNK] cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself\n",

Since my [UNK] is still under warranty (1 year warranty) I requested a RMA for a replacement [UNK] cup [UNK]. The tech asked how it had failed -- mine also had melted to the [UNK] so I had to rip it off -- and responded like he was very familiar with the problem. He also mentioned the rubber material of the original design was defective and that they had a new rubber material design and would send me a new one.

Based on the reviews here, several online fora, and my own personal experience, I can confirm to you that you have about a 30% chance of actually getting this to work, and you might get that percentage up a little bit if you keep returning defective ones and trying another. But why bother? At this point, there are higher-power [UNK]s, high-gain directional antennae, and there are even products sporting 802.11n, which inherently has a better range that -a, -b, or -g. If you've gotten into a situation where your [UNK] is inadequate for your needs, research and get yourself a top-notch [UNK] with good broadcast power--I would strongly recommend against trying to remedy an inadequate [UNK] by trying to add this product to your [UNK]. I understand that my suggestion may be more expensive, but I am seriously saying that you will avoid wasting any more than necesary of the precious remainder of your time on this earth.

      "Amazon was great about shipping this product, but I eventually returned it due to several problems. They were also great about the return -- they paid the return shipping and I got a full refund. I never tried any [UNK]s with this card using the Media Center software that is part of Windows MCE. I was using it with SnapStream BeyondTV 4.1. If you record using anything but the Best (DVD 720x480) quality level it would crop out part of the picture. This is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue. The latest Hauppauge driver did not solve the problem. The other problem I had is that several times when I was [UNK] two programs at the same time, one of the [UNK]s had nothing but static for the audio portion of it. I don't know if this was a problem with the card or BeyondTV, but I think it's probably due to the card. I don't know if I had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards. I also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured. I have Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other PCs, and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card. After reading some reviews, it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also (and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card). BeyondTV works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above; but I also only have one tuner card in the PCs that I use these cards in, so I can't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using BeyondTV. I returned the 500 card, and I instead purchased two VisionTek Xtasy Theater 550 Pro cards. Thus far I'm not having any of the issues with them in BeyondTV that I was having with the Hauppauge 500 card -- I can record at a lower quality level with no cropping, and I've had no audio issues so far. The quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card (although maybe not as good as that captured by the Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards).\n",

I have never been able to have the [UNK] send \"snap shots\" to my e-mail or ftp folder. D-Link tech support confirmed that I was setting it up correctly... but the feature doesn't work. I was told by D-Link tech support that I may need to disable my [UNK] security program. No can do. 5.) D-Link tech support may not have access to this product- they are not able to respond to my inquiries. They would send me answers- but not to the questions I asked! 6.) The weather protection cover is not designed for [UNK] antenna and has been out of stock each time I have tried to purchase- so I have not been able to install on the outside of my home. It therefore must be used inside which is not what I need. I could have paid < $80 for an indoor [UNK]. Every so often, when I have a few hours to burn, I drag it out and try to make the thing work.

Secondly, the build quality is pretty bad. Within a few weeks, the control brick started giving me problems. The [UNK] would go off on one side or the other. A bit annoying. This only happens sporadically, and can be \"fixed\" by squeezing the [UNK] controller. Not quite bad enough for me to seek a replacement, but annoying nonetheless. I've also discovered that the [UNK]s are assembled with screws - screws that aren't properly inserted, and they have a tendency that fall out. Now I have a washer flopping around inside the right [UNK], and I can't find the tiny screw. So I'll have to either try and repair it myself, which means trying to find somewhere I can buy tiny rare screws, or have to send it in for repair. I might as well send it in for repair, because maybe they could also fix the volume controller... Really kind of disappointing for supposedly \"premium\" gaming [UNK]s. The [UNK] is bad enough to almost make it worthless for ventrillo or TS. And the problems with build quality are really unacceptable for [UNK]s of this price.

While it is advertised as a sports [UNK] player, in a lot of respects it isn't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports. My issues are: - Headphones are not at all appropriate for sports, particularly running.. they keep falling off, so I had to invest in a better pair of headphones. Kind of weird since it's supposed to be a sports player. Also, I spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before I could use them. - Hard to change [UNK] while running, and it often ends up doing something I don't want it to. You can't change the [UNK] without removing the [UNK] player from the [UNK], which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can't tell from any picture. - Not easy to figure out the features of the player, such as the stopwatch, pedometer. Also hard to use once you do figure it out. - Software is a pain to use. - Organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player. That being said, I still use it. There are some good features: - Long battery life, recharges super quick - Very cool-looking player - Very easy to carry around.. can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size. I would not recommend this player and if given a choice, I would not buy it again.\n",

      "Usually I discount negative reviews. I think people may have sour grapes against a company, or not understand how to install or work something. I somewhat tech savvy - I installed our [UNK] [UNK] that took a little doing. I work as a technical recruiter, so technology doesn't intimidate me. I like technology. So I had been nudging my husband for a print server so that I could print without going to the [UNK] and plugging in. He came home with this Belkin product and went about installing it. Usually I like to research before I purchase a product, but he wanted to handle this. So, he installed it, and I went back and checked his work, and he had followed the instructions exactly. I know he had some trouble, and had called tech support at my suggestion - I would never have gotten the [UNK] [UNK] hooked up without tech support. The only problem is, that the [UNK] doesn't work. So, I tried installing the software on my pc, and trying to problem solve from there. I called the tech support hotline back, and got an operator who promised to have a technician call me back in a short period of time. I waited for 2 hours, then went out to run some errands. There was still no message from a technician when I returned. This morning my husband needed to get some work done from home. He created a document, and knowing that the print server did not work, he wired up to the [UNK] to print that way. But now, the [UNK] won't respond to the signal, so he can't print that way either. So we deleted the Belkin software and rebooted the computer. He still can't print. So, I went back to my PC, and tried to delete the software through the control panel. It won't delete. I am getting an error message. I can't print either. So now I am on hold with Belkin customer assistance. Maybe it's a coincidence but as good as the english is that the person who refers to himself as an operator is, I swear I hear a little Indian accent. That doesn't mean that customer support has been outsourced to India, and even if it is, that doesn't mean customer support is bad. But my experience with this is that while I can get a real live person on the phone, he can't do a thing to help me except promise me that someone will call back. When I tried to get my problem escalated, I overwhelmed him and he put me on hold. I am still on hold. I have been on hold for 35 minutes with no help in sight. I called back from my cell phone, and someone who sounded so much like the first operator I spoke to said he would escalate my call to a level 2 technician, and someone would call back in 1-2 hours. When I strongly protested, asked for his name, asked for a number I could call directly, he offered to transfer me immediately, and now, I have been on hold for for an additional 10 minutes on my cell phone. I am starting to sense a trend here. My husband - boiling over his inability to print an important document, has gone off to work to print it there. I am sitting on my sofa with phones going on in stereo, waiting to see if anyone in cyberspace is going to pick up my call. I usually discount negative reviews, but this is really my experience with this product, and if you are considering purchasing it, I would encourage you to think that through a little further.\n",

I really like the MD681 but I could never locate one of its expansion [UNK]s (everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock). Overall I'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use I am already looking for another phone. Handheld phones: I like them more than any other phone I've tried. Unlike most phones these days they're big and have a very solid feel to them...it's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation. The buttons are a nice size and easy to use. The hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well. With one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good, but with two people on [UNK]s you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation. The shared [UNK] is a terrific idea but it could have been done better. It's a few clicks and slow to access...almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand...or copy the number to the local units [UNK]...which defeats the purpose. As for the Answer Machine: Once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of how many messages, if any, are in the system (is it just me or is that poor design), so if you listen to messages when you partner isn't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages. The quality of voice messages is a bit grainy. I also like how the [UNK] docked in the older M681; it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base...the MD781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk.\n",

I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my [UNK] (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs).

      "I purchased this product to replace a really good 802.11g unit from [UNK], hoping to set up a Gigabit home network with ethernet storage. I initially considered the [UNK] model, but the reviews were mediocre. So I went instead for this newer model, hoping that [UNK] has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the [UNK] model. I am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the [UNK] also apply to this model. I am returning it after 5 hours of use. On my home network set up with my current [UNK] 802.11g unit, I am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house, and all four movies display flawlessly. On this new unit optimized for streaming video, I was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the [UNK] unit. The movie had interruptions every 4-5 seconds. This was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the [UNK] unit. Performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with G cards and N cards. And performance degraded as I tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time. The speed of the links to my laptops equiped with N cards was 144 Mb/s, and was 54 Mb/s on those equiped with G cards. So the connection seemed fast enough. It might be that by tweaking the [UNK] unit in some way, it might be able to perform as I expect. But I don't have time to waste on such tweaking, and given that my 802.11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box, there is no point to \"upgrade\" to this new flawed model. I'll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out\n",

      "I purchased this item recently at a local Radio Shack because it was on sale for $7.99. In my case, I did not get the abysmal product that others here have encountered, but I did get a disappointing one. I use an older [UNK] writer (NEC NR-7800A) which is capable of burning at a maximum speed of 16X, and I have achieved that speed with other media (notably Imation). In my system, however, these [UNK] discs are limited to a maximum of 8X no matter what data is being burned or what program is being used. Either the disks are substandard or they are not fully compatible with my drive. On the positive side, all the discs used so far have burned successfully and can be read by my DVD-ROM drive, DVD player, and [UNK] player. There's no point in buying this [UNK] product when there are so many others out there. Find a brand that works well with your [UNK] and stick with it. UPDATE: The current model number on [UNK]'s web site for the 50-pack [UNK]-R spindle is 50[UNK]Q80LS3 (not 50[UNK]Q80LS2). If you still want to buy [UNK], try to find the current model number\n",

      "This review is more about the Hi-MD concept in general than one particular player. The sound quality was excellent. The rest of the product and concept deserves to die in the marketplace. Complaints: -The only thing that isn't proprietary is the headphone jack and the AA battery. Beyond that, [UNK]'s dual role as a content provider (complete with nasty intellectual property lawyers) and equipment manufacturer fatally compromises usuability of this line of players. No Macintosh support is just the beginning. Proprietary compression algorithms. Weird and twisted upload/download rules. Wrong choices made at every point of the PRD process. -100x recording speed? Make that 4x on a good day. 100x speed is a specification that should attract the attention of Elliot Spitzer, if he only cared. -The players are flimsy. Just walking with mine caused it to skip. And one hard fall to the floor and it stopped working entirely. [UNK] will charge you to honor the warranty (parts only--no labor). By contrast [UNK] replaced my daughter's iPod no questions asked when it started developing hard disk hiccups. -Trying to find Hi-MDs offers the thrill of the hunt, if you're into that kind of thing. But their rarity suggests that [UNK] is at best half-hearted about supporting this device. I used to be a loyal [UNK] customer, but now believe they have gone almost irretrievably downhill. Sleek designs do not compensate for disfunctional product management and shoddy manufacturing. In fact, I'm planning an HD TV purchase next year and have [UNK] far down on the list of possibilities.

That is why I was in a state of complete shock that this little blue [UNK] walkman is made by [UNK], because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture. First the bad...the control buttons (sound, changing tracks, pause, etc) are tiny and nearly impossible to read. I found myself having to hold the [UNK] player up to my face to find the right button, and I do not have any vision problems. The little l[UNK] screen is hard to read as well. Next, the sound quality is poor and has a cheap \"watered down\" feel to it. Then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with. These are cheap and don't fit well. I bought a yellow \"psyc\" [UNK] walkman a couple years ago, and that one is 3 times the product that this one is. The sound is near-perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use.

It uses a 9-volt [UNK] in each of the two [UNK], and that's another 5 bucks out of my pocket. You know what?

The first thing I noticed is that it's wi-fi wouldn't work with WEP with my [UNK]. It'd work without encryption on the Airport Extreme, but not with WEP or with WPA. I noted that and used it without the wi-fi for a few days. I noted it wouldn't hold time at all consistently. It wouldn't register a network time server's d[UNK] and was always in the wrong time zone, so I had to fidge by seven hours to get it to match my time, but it would still drift about ten minutes per day, and then jump an hour or two randomly, making sorting which file is the more current a bit iffy. I found it slow to mount, and it would sometimes unmount over working WEP wi-fi or hardwired Gigabit connections, which was disheartening. I then decided to call Tech Support, which is when things went from bad to worse... Calls took a minimum 25 minutes to get through initial screening to tech support staff. The tech support staff were not familiar with the product and would transfer me around, which too up to another thirty minutes. Folks with extensions rarely answered or returned calls or e-mails. After *** 12 hours *** with customer support over two weeks and a not-yet-released [UNK] update, it would work with WPA_PSK or open, but still no WEP. They couldn't fix the time drift issue. I repeatedly asked for a replacement, but they always had a few more hoops to make me jump through, whether it be repeating a test for the upmteenth time, or another [UNK] update... they just wouldn't spare me the trouble and replace the unit until I was ready to scream. By this time, I was out of Amazon's return policy timeframe. They refused to give me a refund after repeated attempts. I even sent a letter, telling them to please send a refund check and not another unit or I'd post my experience here on Amazon. Of course, I got a replacement unit with no other reply. Now I've got to get rid of the thing oneBay or whatever, take the loss and move on. I would never buy another D-Link product. I would avoid this thing like anthrax - weaponized anthrax. I bought an Iomega NAS unit, which works very well, has multiple drives and RAID and, though it costs more, provides decent value and it WORKS.

If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair. If you're looking for a value Flash Memory [UNK], I might suggest SanDisk. For one, [UNK] does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products. Two, there are competitors to [UNK] with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices. Three, [UNK] will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced.

I called their Corp office again and after attempting the dial by name directory got to a receptionist named Marti who would not connect me to management.

      "I bought this [UNK] hoping that some of the quality in [UNK]'s excellent enterprise-market [UNK]s would have worn off on adopted child [UNK]. Unfortunately, my experience has me convinced that [UNK] is a red-headed stepchild (my apologies to all you red-heads) who has learned very little from its adoptive parent. That being said, the [UNK] does work out of the box, and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home-network [UNK]s. My perusals of the [UNK] reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub-$300 [UNK]s on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies, and this one is certainly no exception. Pros: This [UNK] is configured to work right out of the box. You can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on, and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen. The HTML-based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use. You don't have to learn one single command line to configure this [UNK]. Default configuration was stealth mode -- meaning the [UNK] did not respond to _any_ unsolicited connection requests, forming a protective \"black hole\" on my IP for most uninvited packets. Cons: Not all of the features worked out of the box. Several of the links in the HTML command pages simply did not link to anything. Strange that [UNK] would ship the firmware without at least taking 30 minutes to hide the links that don't point to anything. Turning on the poorly documented \"firewall\" feature causes the [UNK] to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests. Sometimes the [UNK] responds \"port closed\" to all requests. Sometimes it responds \"port closed\" to some and \"port open\" to others (the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next). Never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration (with \"firewall\" inactive). I'm not sure how the \"firewall\" in this [UNK] is configured to behave, but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature. The [UNK]'s DHCP functionality works great -- when it works. It mysteriously disengages at random intervals, requiring a reboot (and sometimes a flash to factory defaults) to remedy. Flashing a new BIOS image is risky; [UNK] failure during a flash means shipping the [UNK] back to the manufacturer - or File13, if the warranty is out. For what it's worth, I am still using this [UNK]. It serves its basic purpose, and while its functionality issues are annoying, there are workarounds for all of them. I probably will not buy another [UNK], but the problems with this one aren't annoying enough to warrant a return. -sean hennin\n",

      "As you may have read elsewhere, this router has a problem with the [UNK] protocol used by Microsoft for their PPtP server (see Alan Bryant's May 27, 2004 review). This will stop you using it with the built-in PPtP [UNK] client/server which is provided with Windows 2000/XP. Here is the text of a complaint I have submitted to [UNK]... \"I am attempting to operate a Microsoft PPtP server behind a BEFVP41 (firmware 1.41.1). I have PPtP Pass Through enabled and port 1723 forwarded to the fixed IP address of the server but the router refuses to pass the [UNK] protocol used by Microsoft (Protocol 47). In answer ID 737, you suggest forwarding port 47 presumably in a belief that this has something to do with [UNK]. It does not and is therefore not the solution to this problem. [UNK] does not use TCP/UDP port 47, it is 'Protocol 47', something entirely different. It seems that the the writer of answer 737 has neither tested this scenario nor has a true understanding of the nature of this problem. I and others have investigated this problem extensively using protocol analysers at the client and server ends and can only conclude that the present version of firmware in the BEFVP41 (1.41.1) is incapable of handling the [UNK] protocol correctly. Can you please advise when a fix will be implemented? This is seriously devaluing an otherwise good product. I also suggest that you amend answer 737 as it is misleading and will frustrate others less versed in IP protocols than myself.\" I await a reply from [UNK] as I write this review. Having said all that, if you have no interest in running the Microsoft PPtP server, the BEFVP41 may do everything else you require. It functions okay as a basic NAT router and it's stealth capabilities are good (Steve Gibson's 'Shields Up' reports 'True Stealth' as long as you forward port 113 to a non-existant host). The in-built IPSec tunneling works well. I am using one to provide permanant tunnels to a number of BEFSX41's very reliably. The web interface is a little odd at times but it does do the job reasonably and you do get used to it eventually. To summarise: A reasonable basic NAT router. Very good stealth. IPSec tunneling works okay (at least to other [UNK] products). Microsoft's PPtP server will NOT work with the current firmware version.\n",

The soft wires felt flimsy to me when I first opened it, but I thought I'd just take extra care. At 1 month of careful usage, the plastic-covered wires from [UNK] downwards became so weather-hardened that I could almost use them as chopsticks, and makes it so the [UNK] popped out at the slightest motion. At 2 months of careful usage, the wires had half-ripped from the plug--which I repaired the best I could with unsightly electrical tape. However, at 3rd month, the left bud fell completely off.

      "Let me start by saying I was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going. I imagined myself able to locate the kids when we tried to meet up, or find them if we got lost (or god forbid worse). I bought two from Amazon and bought two more from a local [UNK] while waiting for the Amazon order to arrive. I took my girlfriend's niece out for a practice run to see how they all worked...five minutes later mine locked up. I went and found my niece...\"Uncle XXXX, why does the [UNK] look all funny\" The units from the local [UNK] had a problem with the [UNK] locking up...so I exchanged them, but then, so did the two I got in exchange. I thought perhaps I got a bad batch from the local store, but when the Amazon units arrived, they had the same problem. We took them out for a stroll with some friends from MBA school...the unanimous opinion after a few minutes of test use by late 20 year old and early 30s self proclaimed gear lovers...\"dude, these %!\". Forget, locating the people in your party, even if all your friends are incredibly patient geeks. (I should know, I was so excited when I ordered the radios that I applied immediately for a GMRS license with the FCC). The Rino 530's simply don't work well. A combined GPS and family radio seems like such a great concept for a product, but at $400 a unit, they are pathetic. $1600 for four units bought me disappointment, frustration, trips to the store and time on the phone with [UNK] service agents who act surprised that there is a problem. Frankly, the GPS is useless because the [UNK] flips out every seven minutes. You have to stop, remove the belt clip and take the battery off the back and reboot...then it happens all over again a few minutes later. The product becomes a real distraction instead of an enhancement to your outdoor activity...You wind up thinking how great it was when you had $20 radios that worked. I spoke with three Garmin reps who denied they knew of any problem, one told me it was a complicated piece of equipment and occasional crashes were to be expected. Every seven minutes? Come on, Windows 95 was more stable than that. Finally, I got a guy on the phone who said, \"Oh yeah, there's a problem with the 530's, you should avail yourself of the local return policy if you can. If not we can send you some more, but I can't make any promises.\" He explained that they are having an issue with the electric signal to the [UNK] and said they are trying to develop a firmware solution. Reading the other reviews, I'd guess they've been unsuccessfully working on one for more than a year now...and through multiple software releases. I am not holding my breath for working a firmware repair. I've certainly bought products that had bugs and got better with firmware releases (Linksys routers for instance, Palm Treo's) but this is no $50 router, (or generally stable $400 phone) and frankly, I have to reset my router once every four months at most. This product is really bad, I wish it were better because the concept is great, but I would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to keep your money and save yourself the headache.\n",

      "Pro --- * Compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket, yet opens to a comfortable working size with full-sized keys, including a number row. For those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets, this is decidedly a deal-maker over the Stowaway [UNK] which requires alt-key combinations to access numbers and symbols. The full-size keys require no revamping of [UNK] habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the Freedom [UNK]. To my knowledge, there is no other folding bluetooth [UNK] on the market at the time of this writing which has *both* full-size keys *and* a number/symbol row. * The bluetooth connection is clean, lag free, and accurate. Con --- * The software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome, requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use, and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement (see below). * Flimsy Locking Mechanism / Not Usable on a Lap. The manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened [UNK] flat \"while on your lap or on a non-flat surface\". This \"lock\" is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip, which travels 7/8\" along the top of the board from the left half into the right. Even when locked, the [UNK] doesn't lay flat, and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user's legs, held in place only by one thin piece of wire, the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated \"V\" shape after any amount of light-handed [UNK]. HP could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics. A user must find a solid flat surface to type on, such as a book. And of course, when sitting on a flat surface, the lock isn't needed. * The manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless [UNK] is to \"enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your...PocketPC\". Unfortunately, the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non-removable cradle. A quick look at the Freedom [UNK]'s pull-out cradle offers HP a lesson in how to do it right. * The [UNK] ships with no case, as do most other portable [UNK]s with non-rugged exteriors. The attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys. * It doesn't turn off. Yes, you read that last bullet correctly: You can't turn this thing off. There's no power switch. The button in the upper right corner of the [UNK] is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld; it's not a power switch. What this means is, even when folded and not in use, even when appearing to be dormant, and even when the software shows that there's no bluetooth connection, the [UNK] is still eating your batteries. The automatic \"sleep mode\" simply disables the wireless connection; it does not power down the [UNK]. Two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the [UNK], you'll return to find them dead. Not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes. The only way to power down the [UNK] is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries. The battery cover, need I add, breaks easilly. Sound unbelievable? Go to the major websites dedicated to PocketPCs, and do a search of their forums using the keywords \"bluetooth [UNK]\". This is not a case of a know-nothing customer who needs to read the manual. The manual, such as it is, makes no mention of an absent power switch. For the mobile user then, in addition to the [UNK] itself, one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on, to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired, to carry the batteries separately, and to re-enter the access key into the software after reinserting those batteries. Although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket, the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile [UNK] for the mobile user. Add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use, the HP iPaq [UNK] is worth perhaps 1/3 it's $100 retail price, and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full-size keys and number row. How HP ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me. All potential buyers of iPaq handhelds should take this [UNK] as a reflection of what, if any, emphasis HP places on quality of design and the integrity of iPaq name. It reflects also the degree of respect HP has for the intelligence of their customers. One might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non-removable cradle, or the parsimony of not including a case. One might even forgive the useless locking mechanism. But when HP is either too dumb to include an on/off switch, or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care, then I must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the iPaq name. If HP is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for $100, then I cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a PocketPC for $300-400. My next handheld upgrade, I'll probably stay with Fujitsu-Siemens Loox (I currently use a Loox720, a truly excellent PPC), or maybe go with a Dell Axim. I won't even consider an iPaq. The HP Bluetooth [UNK] is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality. Those at HP responsible for protecting public perception of the iPaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves.\n",

[UNK] has tools on their site to check your [UNK] status, and sure enough it was due for an RMA. When I checked the [UNK] status online, 6 months had mysteriously 'vanished' from my [UNK] period. The drive [UNK] had started 6 months before I'd purchased it! Anyway, it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick. Still, this is my second [UNK] drive to die, and I'm going with other brands from now.\n",

They should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the [UNK] of a softer material, or created a design where it won't rub against the laptop. Really stupid design. It may have protected against some very minor scratches,but likely I'm worse off for using this [UNK] (scratches on the outside of the [UNK] are more evenly dispersed than those now on the [UNK] but both are of similar severity).

It has been three days now and they have not even returned my emails. Customer service for this product is nonexistant. I joined the Yahoo message board and got a simple answer to my question in about four hours someone posted the answer. Turns out I just had to go to the Menu -- Card Utilities and maunually select the [UNK]. I did not know that [UNK]s dont change automaticaly like the detailed maps do. I cannt say enough great things about my experience with my [UNK] meridian color though. Navigating through Hungary like a pro, I didnt miss a single turn. I would never recommend any of their products to someone who isnt willing or doesnt have the aptitude to learn about it. The [UNK] Meridian series is in my opinion the finest product on the market for what it does, portability it provides and is 100 percent upgradable with new software and new maps. Get you head out of your a__ Thales. You have some great products, but you are blowing your customer support base with non existant customer support.

Further, I was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using [UNK] OS X [UNK].

I uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out, only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with. It's got large rubber triming down each side, so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons. I only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will NEVER, EVER, be able to reach them during game play. It also feels too long and flat, so the scroll wheel is note easily reached, and your hand does not rest comfortably. Yeah, it looks great, and I'm sure it's doing an amazing job a moving precisely.
